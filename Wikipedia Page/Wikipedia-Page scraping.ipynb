A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King\\xa0Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and other forms of legalized discrimination. \\nKing participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights.[1] He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the 1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\\nThe SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently.[2] King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI\\'s COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.[3]\\nOn October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance.  In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People\\'s Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was convicted of the assassination, though the King family believes he was a scapegoat; the assassination remains the subject of conspiracy theories. King\\'s death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King\\xa0Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\\nEarly life and education\\nBirth\\nKing was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née\\xa0Williams).[4][5][6] King had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel \"A. D.\" King.[7] Alberta\\'s father, Adam Daniel Williams,[8] was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893,[6] and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year.[9] Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks.[6] King Sr. was born to sharecroppers James Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia,[5][6] and was of African-Irish descent.[10][11][12] As an adolescent, King Sr. left his parents\\' farm and walked to Atlanta, where he attained a high school education,[13][14][15] and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry.[15] King Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926.[16][17] Until Jennie\\'s death in 1941, they lived together on the second floor of Alberta\\'s parents\\' Victorian house, where King was born.[18][16][17][19]\\nShortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church.[17] Senior pastor Williams died in the spring of 1931[17] and, that fall, King Sr. took the role. With support from his wife, he would raise attendance from six hundred to several thousand.[6][17][20] In 1934, the church sent King Sr. on a multinational trip, including to Berlin for the Congress of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA).[21] He also visited sites in Germany that were associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther.[21] In reaction to the rise of Nazism, the BWA issued a resolution stating, \"This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world.\"[22] On returning home in August 1934, King Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son\\'s name to Martin Luther King Jr.[21][23][16][a]Early childhood\\nKing\\'s childhood home in Atlanta, Georgia\\nAt his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father.[25] After dinners, King\\'s grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as \"Mama\", would tell lively stories from the Bible.[25] King\\'s father would regularly use whippings to discipline his children,[26] sometimes having them whip each other.[26] King\\'s father later remarked, \"[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He\\'d stand there, and the tears would run down, and he\\'d never cry.\"[27] Once, when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it.[26][28] When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive.[29][28] King, believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window,[30][28] but rose from the ground on hearing that she was alive.[30]\\nKing became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his home.[31] In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school.[31][32] King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School,[31][33] while his playmate went to a separate school for white children only.[31][33] Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, \"we are white, and you are colored\".[31][34] When King relayed this to his parents, they discussed with him the history of slavery and racism in America,[31][35] which King would later state made him \"determined to hate every white person\".[31] His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.[35]\\nKing witnessed his father stand up against segregation and discrimination.[36] Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as \"boy\", King\\'s father responded sharply that King Jr. was a boy but he was a man.[36] When King\\'s father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back.[37] King\\'s father refused, stating \"we\\'ll either buy shoes sitting here or we won\\'t buy any shoes at all\", before leaving the store with King.[14] He told King afterward, \"I don\\'t care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.\"[14] In 1936, King\\'s father led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination.[26] King later remarked that King Sr. was \"a real father\" to him.[38]\\nKing memorized hymns and Bible verses by the time he was five years old.[30] Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing hymns while she played piano.[30] His favorite hymn was \"I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus\"; he moved attendees with his singing.[30] King later became a member of the junior choir in his church.[39] King enjoyed opera, and played the piano.[40] King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries.[28] He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stymie fights.[28][40] King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait that persisted throughout his life.[40] In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir in slave costume, for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film Gone with the Wind.[41][42] In September 1940, at the age of 11, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the seventh grade.[43][44] While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and showed keen interest in history and English classes.[43]\\nOn May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother.[38] Upon returning home, he learned she had a heart attack and died while being transported to a hospital.[19] He took the death very hard and believed that his deception of going to see the parade may have been responsible for God taking her.[19] King jumped out of a second-story window at his home, but again survived.[19][27][28] His father instructed him that King should not blame himself, and that she had been called home to God as part of God\\'s plan.[19][45] King struggled with this.[19] Shortly thereafter, King\\'s father decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta.[19]Adolescence\\nThe high school that King attended was named after African-American educator Booker T. Washington.\\nAs an adolescent, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the \"racial humiliation\" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure.[46] In 1942, when King was 13, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal.[47] That year, King skipped the ninth grade and was enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School, where he maintained a B-plus average.[45][48] The high school was the only one in the city for African-American students.[17]\\nWhile King was brought up in a Baptist home, as he entered adolescence he began to question the literalist teachings preached at his father\\'s church.[45][49] At the age of 13, he denied the bodily resurrection of Jesus during Sunday school.[50][49] King said that he found himself unable to identify with the emotional displays from congregants frequent at his church, and doubted if he would ever attain personal satisfaction from religion.[51][49] He later stated of this point in his life, \"doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly.\"[52][50][49]\\nIn high school, King became known for his public-speaking ability, with a voice that had grown into an orotund baritone.[53][48] He joined the school\\'s debate team.[53][48] King continued to be most drawn to history and English,[48] and chose English and sociology as his main subjects.[54] King maintained an abundant vocabulary.[48] However, he relied on his sister Christine to help him with spelling, while King assisted her with math.[48] King also developed an interest in fashion, commonly wearing polished patent leather shoes and tweed suits, which gained him the nickname \"Tweed\" or \"Tweedie\" among his friends.[55][56][57][58] He liked flirting with girls and dancing.[57][56][59] His brother A.D. later remarked, \"He kept flitting from chick to chick, and I decided I couldn\\'t keep up with him. Especially since he was crazy about dances, and just about the best jitterbug in town.\"[56]\\nOn April 13, 1944, in his junior year, King gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest.[60][56][61][62] In his speech he stated, \"black America still wears chains. The finest negro is at the mercy of the meanest white man.\"[63][60] King was selected as the winner of the contest.[60][56] On the ride home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit.[56][64] The driver of the bus called King a \"black son-of-a-bitch\".[56] King initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not.[64] As all the seats were occupied, he and his teacher were forced to stand the rest of the way to Atlanta.[56] Later King wrote of the incident: \"That night will never leave my memory. It was the angriest I have ever been in my life.\"[64]Morehouse College\\nDuring King\\'s junior year in high school, Morehouse College—an all-male historically black college that King\\'s father and maternal grandfather had attended[65][66]—began accepting high school juniors who passed the entrance examination.[56][67][64] As World War II was underway many black college students had been enlisted,[56][67] so the university aimed to increase their enrolment by allowing juniors to apply.[56][67][64] In 1944, aged 15, King passed the examination and was enrolled at the university that autumn.[b][56][67][65][68]\\nIn the summer before King started at Morehouse, he boarded a train with his friend—Emmett \"Weasel\" Proctor—and a group of other Morehouse College students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut, at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco.[69][70] This was King\\'s first trip into the integrated north.[71][72] In a June 1944 letter to his father King wrote about the differences that struck him: \"On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see. After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit anywhere we want to.\"[71] The farm had partnered with Morehouse College to allot their salaries towards the university\\'s tuition, housing, and fees.[69][70] On weekdays King and the other students worked in the fields, picking tobacco from 7:00am to at least 5:00pm, enduring temperatures above 100\\xa0°F, to earn roughly USD$4 per day.[70][71] On Friday evenings, the students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to Hartford, Connecticut, to see theatre performances, shop and eat in restaurants.[70][72] On Sundays they attended church services in Hartford, at a church filled with white congregants.[70] King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation, relaying how he was amazed they could go to \"one of the finest restaurants in Hartford\" and that \"Negroes and whites go to the same church\".[70][73][71]\\nHe played freshman football there. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He would later credit the college\\'s president, Baptist minister Benjamin Mays, with being his \"spiritual mentor\".[74] King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer \"an inner urge to serve humanity\", and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a \"rational\" minister with sermons that were \"a respectful force for ideas, even social protest.\"[75] King graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 1948, aged nineteen.[76]Religious education\\nKing received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Crozer Theological Seminary in 1951 (pictured in 2009).\\nSee also: Martin Luther King Jr. authorship issues\\nKing enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania,[77][78] and took several courses at the University of Pennsylvania.[79][80] At Crozer, King was elected president of the student body.[81] At Penn, King took courses with William Fontaine, Penn\\'s first African-American professor, and Elizabeth F. Flower, a professor of philosophy.[82] King\\'s father supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with J. Pius Barbour, a family friend and Crozer alumnus who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania.[83] King became known as one of the \"Sons of Calvary\", an honor he shared with William Augustus Jones Jr. and Samuel D. Proctor, who both went on to become well-known preachers.[84]\\nKing once reproved another student for keeping beer in his room, saying they shared responsibility as African Americans to bear \"the burdens of the Negro race\". For a time, he was interested in Walter Rauschenbusch\\'s \"social gospel\".[81] In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with[85] the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked in the cafeteria. King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King\\'s father,[85] advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother\\'s pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. One friend was quoted as saying, \"He never recovered.\"[81] Other friends, including Harry Belafonte, said Betty had been \"the love of King\\'s life.\"[85] King graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity in 1951.[77] He applied to the University of Edinburgh for a doctorate in the School of Divinity but ultimately chose Boston instead.[86]\\nIn 1951, King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University,[87] and worked as an assistant minister at Boston\\'s historic Twelfth Baptist Church with William Hunter Hester. Hester was an old friend of King\\'s father and was an important influence on King.[88] In Boston, King befriended a small cadre of local ministers his age, and sometimes guest pastored at their churches, including Michael Haynes, associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. The young men often held bull sessions in their apartments, discussing theology, sermon style, and social issues.\\nAt the age of 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.[89] King received his PhD on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation (initially supervised by Edgar S. Brightman and, upon the latter\\'s death, by Lotan Harold DeWolf) titled A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.[90][87]\\nAn academic inquiry in October 1991 concluded that portions of his doctoral dissertation had been plagiarized and he had acted improperly. However, \"[d]espite its finding, the committee said that \\'no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King\\'s doctoral degree,\\' an action that the panel said would serve no purpose.\"[91][87][92] The committee found that the dissertation still \"makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship.\" A letter is now attached to the copy of King\\'s dissertation in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources.[93] Significant debate exists on how to interpret King\\'s plagiarism.[94]Marriage and family\\nMartin Luther King Jr. with his wife, Coretta Scott King, and daughter, Yolanda Denise King, in 1956\\nWhile studying at Boston University, he asked a friend from Atlanta named Mary Powell, a student at the New England Conservatory of Music, if she knew any nice Southern girls. Powell spoke to fellow student Coretta Scott; Scott was not interested in dating preachers but eventually agreed to allow King to telephone her based on Powell\\'s description and vouching. On their first call, King told Scott, \"I am like Napoleon at Waterloo before your charms,\" to which she replied, \"You haven\\'t even met me.\" King married Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents\\' house, in Heiberger, Alabama.[95] They had four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b. 1957), Dexter Scott King (1961–2024), and Bernice King (b. 1963).[96] King limited Coretta\\'s role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.[97]Activism and organizational leadership\\nMontgomery bus boycott, 1955\\nMain articles: Montgomery bus boycott and Jim Crow laws §\\xa0Public arena\\nKing (left) with civil rights activist Rosa Parks (right) in 1955\\nThe Dexter Avenue Baptist Church was influential in the Montgomery African-American community. As the church\\'s pastor, King became known for his oratorical preaching in Montgomery and the surrounding region.[98]\\nIn March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation.[99] Nine months later on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus.[100] The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Edgar Nixon and led by King.[101] The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant but decided to do so if no one else wanted it.[102]\\nThe boycott lasted for 385 days,[103] and the situation became so tense that King\\'s house was bombed.[104] King was arrested for traveling 30\\xa0mph in a 25\\xa0mph zone[105] and jailed, which overnight drew the attention of national media, and greatly increased King\\'s public stature. The controversy ended when the United States District Court issued a ruling in Browder v. Gayle that prohibited racial segregation on Montgomery public buses.[106][1][102]\\nKing\\'s role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.[107]King first rose to prominence in the civil rights movement while minister of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.\\nSouthern Christian Leadership Conference\\nIn 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King,[108] as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker.[109] King led the SCLC until his death.[110] The SCLC\\'s 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.[111]\\nHarry Wachtel joined King\\'s legal advisor Clarence B. Jones in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case Abernathy et al. v. Sullivan; the case was litigated about the newspaper advertisement \"Heed Their Rising Voices\". Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit\\'s expenses and assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. King served as honorary president of this organization, named the \"Gandhi Society for Human Rights\". In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on President Kennedy to issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order.[112] The FBI, under written directive from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, began tapping King\\'s telephone line in the fall of 1963.[113] Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration\\'s civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.[114] FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years, as part of its COINTELPRO program, in attempts to force King out of his leadership position.[3]\\nKing believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights supporters, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.[115][116]\\nKing organized and led marches for blacks\\' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights.[1] Most of these rights were successfully enacted into law with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.[117][118]\\nThe SCLC used tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.[2]Survived knife attack, 1958\\nOn September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book Stride Toward Freedom in Blumstein\\'s department store in Harlem[119] when Izola Curry—a mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communists—stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, which nearly impinged on the aorta. King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano.[120] King underwent emergency surgery by Aubre de Lambert Maynard, Emil Naclerio and John W. V. Cordice; he remained hospitalized for several weeks. Curry was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial.[121][122]Atlanta sit-ins, prison sentence, and the 1960 elections\\nKing led the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and later became co-pastor with his father at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta (pulpit and sanctuary pictured).\\nIn December 1959, after being based in Montgomery for five years, King announced his return to Atlanta at the request of the SCLC.[123] In Atlanta, King served until his death as co-pastor with his father at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver expressed open hostility towards King\\'s return. He claimed that \"wherever M. L. King Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes\", and vowed to keep King under surveillance.[124] On May 4, 1960, King drove writer Lillian Smith to Emory University when police stopped them. King was cited for \"driving without a license\" because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license. King\\'s Alabama license was still valid, and Georgia law did not mandate any time limit for issuing a local license.[125] King paid a fine but was unaware that his lawyer agreed to a plea deal that included probation.\\nMeanwhile, the Atlanta Student Movement had been acting to desegregate businesses and public spaces, organizing the Atlanta sit-ins from March 1960 onwards. In August the movement asked King to participate in a mass October sit-in, timed to highlight how 1960\\'s Presidential election campaign had ignored civil rights. The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside Rich\\'s, Atlanta\\'s largest department store, and was among the many arrested that day. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except for King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor. Before dawn the next day, King was transported to Georgia State Prison.[126]\\nThe arrest and harsh sentence drew nationwide attention. Many feared for King\\'s safety, as he started a prison sentence with people convicted of violent crimes, many of them White and hostile to his activism.[127] Both Presidential candidates were asked to weigh in, at a time when both parties were courting the support of Southern Whites and their political leadership including Governor Vandiver. Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship before, declined to make a statement despite a personal visit from Jackie Robinson requesting his intervention. Nixon\\'s opponent John F. Kennedy called the governor (a Democrat) directly, enlisted his brother Robert to exert more pressure on state authorities, and, at the personal request of Sargent Shriver, called King\\'s wife to offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later. King\\'s father decided to openly endorse Kennedy\\'s candidacy for the November 8 election which he narrowly won.[128]\\nAfter the October 19 sit-ins and following unrest, a 30-day truce was declared in Atlanta for desegregation negotiations. However, the negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city\\'s lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools.[129][130] Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a large meeting on March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated. King then gave an impassioned speech calling participants to resist the \"cancerous disease of disunity\", helping to calm tensions.[131]Albany Movement, 1961\\nMain article: Albany Movement\\nThe Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany, Georgia, in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation in the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he \"had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel.\"[132] The following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, \"that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city\" after he left.[132]\\nKing returned in July 1962 and was given the option of forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine (equivalent to $1,700 in 2022); he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King\\'s fine to be paid and ordered his release. \"We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools\\xa0... ejected from churches\\xa0... and thrown into jail\\xa0... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail.\"[133] It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out.[134]\\nAfter nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a \"Day of Penance\" to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts.[135] Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement,[136] the national media was highly critical of King\\'s role in the defeat, and the SCLC\\'s lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.[137]Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy with King, Benjamin Mays, and other civil rights leaders, June 22, 1963\\nBirmingham campaign, 1963\\nMain article: Birmingham campaign\\nKing was arrested in 1963 for protesting the treatment of blacks in Birmingham.[138]\\nIn April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Wyatt Tee Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.\\nKing\\'s intent was to provoke mass arrests and \"create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.\"[139] The campaign\\'s early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police\\'s actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist James Bevel changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join the demonstrations.[140] Newsweek called this strategy a Children\\'s Crusade.[141][142]\\nThe Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement.[143] Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm\\'s way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the \"Jim Crow\" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King\\'s reputation improved immensely.[141]\\nKing was arrested and jailed early in the campaign—his 13th arrest[144] out of 29.[145] From his cell, he composed the now-famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" that responds to calls to pursue legal channels for social change. The letter has been described as \"one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner\".[146] King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: \"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\"[147] He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, \"everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was \\'legal\\'.\"[147] Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged for $160,000 to bail out King and his fellow protestors.[148]\"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\\'s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen\\'s Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man\\'s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\"\\n—Martin Luther King Jr.[147]March on Washington, 1963\\nMain article: March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom\\nLeaders of the March on Washington posing in front of the Lincoln Memorial\\nThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (1963)\\nKing, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the \"Big Six\" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were Roy Wilkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young, National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis, SNCC; and James L. Farmer Jr., Congress of Racial Equality.[149]\\nBayard Rustin\\'s open homosexuality, support of socialism, and former ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin,[150] which King agreed to do.[151] However, he did collaborate in the 1963 March on Washington, for which Rustin was the primary organizer.[152][153] For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of President Kennedy in changing the focus of the march.[154][155] Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed.[156] With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000 and enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators.[157]The March, a 1964 documentary film produced by the United States Information Agency. King\\'s speech has been redacted from this video because of the copyright held by King\\'s estate.\\nThe march originally was planned to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and place organizers\\' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation\\'s capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.[158] As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the \"Farce on Washington\", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending.[158][159]King gave his most famous speech, \"I Have a Dream\", before the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.I Have a Dream30-second sample from \"I Have a Dream\" speech by Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963\\nProblems playing this file? See media help.The march made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers (equivalent to $19 in 2022); and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee.[160][161][162] Despite tensions, the march was a resounding success.[163] More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.\\'s history.[163]\\nKing delivered a 17-minute speech, later known as \"I Have a Dream\". In the speech\\'s most famous passage\\xa0– in which he departed from his prepared text, possibly at the prompting of Mahalia Jackson, who shouted behind him, \"Tell them about the dream!\"[164][165]\\xa0– King said:[166]\\nI say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.\\n\"I Have a Dream\" came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory.[167] The March, and especially King\\'s speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[168][169]\\nSt. Augustine, Florida, 1964\\nMain article: St. Augustine movement\\nIn March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling\\'s then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida. Hayling\\'s group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was forced out of the organization for advocating armed self-defense alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them.[170][171] King and the SCLC worked to bring white Northern activists to St. Augustine, including a delegation of rabbis and the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, all of whom were arrested.[172][173] During June, the movement marched nightly through the city, \"often facing counter demonstrations by the Klan, and provoking violence that garnered national media attention.\" Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed. During this movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.[174]Biddeford, Maine, 1964\\nOn May 7, 1964, King spoke at Saint Francis College\\'s \"The Negro and the Quest for Identity\", in Biddeford, Maine. This was a symposium that brought together many civil rights leaders.[175][176] King spoke about how \"We must get rid of the idea of superior and inferior races,\" through nonviolent tactics.[177]New York City, 1964\\nKing at a press conference in March 1964\\nOn February 6, 1964, King delivered the inaugural speech[178] of a lecture series initiated at the New School called \"The American Race Crisis\". In his remarks, King referred to a conversation he had recently had with Jawaharlal Nehru in which he compared the sad condition of many African Americans to that of India\\'s untouchables.[179] In his March 18, 1964, interview with Robert Penn Warren, King compared his activism to his father\\'s, citing his training in non-violence as a key difference. He also discusses the next phase of the civil rights movement and integration.[180]Scripto strike in Atlanta, 1964\\nMain article: 1964–1965 Scripto strike\\nStarting in November 1964, King supported a labor strike by several hundred workers at the Scripto factory in Atlanta, just a few blocks from Ebenezer Baptist.[181] Many of the strikers were congregants of his church, and the strike was supported by other civil rights leaders.[181] King helped elevate the labor dispute from a local to nationally known event and led the SCLC to organize a nationwide boycott of Scripto products.[181] However, as the strike stretched into December, King, who was wanting to focus more on a civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, began to negotiate in secret with Scripto\\'s president Carl Singer and eventually brokered a deal where the SCLC would call off their boycott in exchange for the company giving the striking employees their Christmas bonuses.[181] King\\'s involvement in the strike ended on December 24 and a contract between the company and union was signed on January 9.[181]Selma voting rights movement and \"Bloody Sunday\", 1965\\nMain article: Selma to Montgomery marches\\nThe civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965\\nIn December 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Selma, Alabama, where the SNCC had been working on voter registration for several months.[182] A local judge issued an injunction that barred any gathering of three or more people affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named civil rights leaders. This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965.[183] During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.\\nActing on James Bevel\\'s call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Bevel and other SCLC members, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march to the state\\'s capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel\\'s nonviolence strategy.[52]\\nOn March 5, King met with officials in the Johnson Administration to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, \"If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.\"[184] Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.[185]\\nKing next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement.[186] The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.[187][188] At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as \"How Long, Not Long\". King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, \"because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\" and \"you shall reap what you sow\".[c][189][190][191]Chicago open housing movement, 1966\\nMain article: Chicago Freedom Movement\\nKing standing behind President Johnson as he signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\nIn 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S. Hamlin Avenue, in the slums of North Lawndale[192] on Chicago\\'s West Side, as an educational experience and to demonstrate their support and empathy for the poor.[193]\\nThe SCLC formed a coalition with Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), an organization founded by Albert Raby, and the combined organizations\\' efforts were fostered under the aegis of the Chicago Freedom Movement.[194]\\nDuring that spring, several white couple/black couple tests of real estate offices uncovered racial steering, discriminatory processing of housing requests by couples who were exact matches in income and background.[195] Several larger marches were planned and executed: in Bogan, Belmont Cragin, Jefferson Park, Evergreen Park, Gage Park, Marquette Park, and others.[194][196][197]President Lyndon B. Johnson meeting with King in the White House Cabinet Room in 1966\\nKing later stated and Abernathy wrote that the movement received a worse reception in Chicago than in the South. Marches, especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5, 1966, were met by thrown bottles and screaming throngs. Rioting seemed very possible.[198][199] King\\'s beliefs militated against his staging a violent event, and he negotiated an agreement with Mayor Richard J. Daley to cancel a march in order to avoid the violence that he feared would result.[200] King was hit by a brick during one march, but continued to lead marches in the face of personal danger.[201]\\nWhen King and his allies returned to the South, they left Jesse Jackson, a seminary student who had previously joined the movement in the South, in charge of their organization.[202] Jackson continued their struggle for civil rights by organizing the Operation Breadbasket movement that targeted chain stores that did not deal fairly with blacks.[203]\\nA 1967 CIA document declassified in 2017 downplayed King\\'s role in the \"black militant situation\" in Chicago, with a source stating that King \"sought at least constructive, positive projects.\"[204]Opposition to the Vietnam War\\nThe black revolution is much more than a struggle for the rights of Negroes. It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flaws—racism, poverty, militarism, and materialism. It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society. It reveals systemic rather than superficial flaws and suggests that radical reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced\\n–Martin Luther King Jr.[205]We must recognize that we can\\'t solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power... this means a revolution of values and other things. We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation, and militarism are all tied together… you can\\'t really get rid of one without getting rid of the others… the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.\\n—Martin Luther King Jr.[206]See also: Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War\\nKing was long opposed to American involvement in the Vietnam War,[207] but at first avoided the topic in public speeches to avoid the interference with civil rights goals that criticism of President Johnson\\'s policies might have created.[207] At the urging of SCLC\\'s former Director of Direct Action and now the head of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, James Bevel, and inspired by the outspokenness of Muhammad Ali,[208] King eventually agreed to publicly oppose the war as opposition was growing among the American public.[207]\\nDuring an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church, King delivered a speech titled \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence\".[209] He spoke strongly against the U.S.\\'s role in the war, arguing that the U.S. was in Vietnam \"to occupy it as an American colony\"[210] and calling the U.S. government \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today\".[211] He connected the war with economic injustice, arguing that the country needed serious moral change:A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: \"This is not just.\"[212] \\nKing opposed the Vietnam War because it took money and resources that could have been spent on social welfare at home. He summed up this aspect by saying, \"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\"[212] He stated that North Vietnam \"did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands\",[213] and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, \"mostly children\".[214] King also criticized American opposition to North Vietnam\\'s land reforms.[215]\\nKing\\'s opposition cost him significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, Billy Graham, union leaders and powerful publishers.[216][217][218] \"The press is being stacked against me\", King said,[219] complaining of what he described as a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied \"toward little brown Vietnamese children\".[220] Life magazine called the speech \"demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi\",[212] and The Washington Post declared that King had \"diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.\"[220][221]King speaking to an anti-Vietnam war rally at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul on April 27, 1967\\nThe \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech reflected King\\'s evolving political advocacy in his later years, which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center, with which he was affiliated.[222][223] King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the American political and economic situation, and more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct injustice.[224][225] He guarded his language in public to avoid being linked to communism, but in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism.[226][227]\\nKing stated in \"Beyond Vietnam\" that \"true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar\\xa0... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\"[228] King quoted a U.S. official who said that from Vietnam to Latin America, the country was \"on the wrong side of a world revolution.\"[228] King condemned America\\'s \"alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America\", and said that the U.S. should support \"the shirtless and barefoot people\" in the Third World rather than suppressing their attempts at revolution.[228]\\nKing\\'s stance on Vietnam encouraged Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, with the support of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal as he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited to activism.[229]\\nOn April 15, 1967, King spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan\\'s Central Park to the United Nations. The march was organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam under chairman James Bevel. At the U.N. King brought up issues of civil rights and the draft:I have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements. There are people who have come to see the moral imperative of equality, but who cannot yet see the moral imperative of world brotherhood. I would like to see the fervor of the civil-rights movement imbued into the peace movement to instill it with greater strength. And I believe everyone has a duty to be in both the civil-rights and peace movements. But for those who presently choose but one, I would hope they will finally come to see the moral roots common to both.[230]\\nSeeing an opportunity to unite civil rights and anti-war activists,[208] Bevel convinced King to become even more active in the anti-war effort.[208] Despite his growing public opposition to the Vietnam War, King was not fond of the hippie culture which developed from the anti-war movement.[231] In his 1967 Massey Lecture, King stated:The importance of the hippies is not in their unconventional behavior, but in the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people, in turning to a flight from reality, are expressing a profoundly discrediting view on the society they emerge from.[231]\\nOn January 13, 1968, King called for a large march on Washington against \"one of history\\'s most cruel and senseless wars\":[232][233]We need to make clear in this political year, to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the United States, that we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killings of Vietnamese and Americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self-determination in Southeast Asia.[232][233]\\nCorrespondence with Thích Nhất Hạnh\\nThích Nhất Hạnh was an influential Vietnamese Buddhist who wrote a letter to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965 entitled: \"In Search of the Enemy of Man\". It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War.[234] In 1967, King gave a famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam.[235] Later that year, King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, \"I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity\".[236]Poor People\\'s Campaign, 1968\\nMain article: Poor People\\'s Campaign\\nA shantytown established in Washington, D.C. to protest economic conditions as a part of the Poor People\\'s Campaign\\nIn 1968, King and the SCLC organized the \"Poor People\\'s Campaign\" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \"economic bill of rights\".[237][238]\\nThe campaign was preceded by King\\'s final book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from Henry George\\'s book Progress and Poverty, particularly in support of a guaranteed basic income.[239][240][241] The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the U.S.\\nKing and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America\\'s cities. He felt that Congress had shown \"hostility to the poor\" by spending \"military funds with alacrity and generosity\". He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided \"poverty funds with miserliness\".[238] His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of \"racism, poverty, militarism and materialism\", and argued that \"reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced.\"[242]\\nThe Poor People\\'s Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate repression on the poor and the black.[243]Global policy\\nKing was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution.[244][245] As a result, in 1968 a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.[246]Assassination and aftermath\\nMain article: Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\\nThe Lorraine Motel, where King was assassinated, is now the site of the National Civil Rights Museum.I\\'ve Been to the MountaintopFinal 30 seconds of \"I\\'ve Been to the Mountaintop\" speech by Martin Luther King Jr.\\nProblems playing this file? See media help.On March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of the black sanitation workers, who were represented by AFSCME Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.[247][248][249]\\nOn April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his \"I\\'ve Been to the Mountaintop\" address at Mason Temple. King\\'s flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane.[250] In reference to the bomb threat, King said:And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?\\nWell, I don\\'t know what will happen now. We\\'ve got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn\\'t matter with me now. Because I\\'ve been to the mountaintop. And I don\\'t mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I\\'m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God\\'s will. And He\\'s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I\\'ve looked over. And I\\'ve seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I\\'m happy, tonight. I\\'m not worried about anything. I\\'m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.[251]\\nKing was booked in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Ralph Abernathy, who was present at the assassination, testified to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations that King and his entourage stayed at Room 306 so often that it was known as the \"King-Abernathy suite\".[252] According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King\\'s last words were spoken to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: \"Ben, make sure you play \\'Take My Hand, Precious Lord\\' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\"[253]\\nKing was fatally shot by James Earl Ray at 6:01\\xa0p.m., Thursday, April 4, 1968, as he stood on the motel\\'s second-floor balcony. The bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder.[254][255] Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the floor.[256]\\nAfter emergency surgery, King died at St. Joseph\\'s Hospital at 7:05\\xa0p.m.[257] According to biographer Taylor Branch, King\\'s autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he \"had the heart of a 60 year old\", which Branch attributed to stress.[258] King was initially interred in South View Cemetery in South Atlanta, but in 1977, his remains were transferred to a tomb on the site of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park.[259]Aftermath\\nFurther information: King assassination riots\\nThe assassination led to race riots in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, Louisville, Kansas City, and dozens of other cities.[260][261][262] Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign rally when he was informed of King\\'s death. He gave a short, improvised speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King\\'s ideal of nonviolence.[263] The following day, he delivered a prepared response in Cleveland.[264] James Farmer Jr. and other civil rights leaders also called for non-violent action, while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more forceful response.[265] The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.[266]\\nThe plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King\\'s plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations to carry it out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered.[267] Thousands of demonstrators arrived on the National Mall and stayed for six weeks, establishing a camp they called \"Resurrection City\".[268]\\nPresident Johnson tried to quell the riots by making telephone calls to civil rights leaders, mayors and governors across the United States and told politicians that they should warn the police against the unwarranted use of force.[262] However, \"I\\'m not getting through,\" Johnson told his aides. \"They\\'re all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.\"[262] Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for King.[269]\\nVice President Hubert Humphrey attended King\\'s funeral on behalf of the President, as there were fears that Johnson\\'s presence might incite protests and perhaps violence.[270] At his widow\\'s request, King\\'s last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, given on February 4, 1968, was played at the funeral:[271]I\\'d like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I\\'d like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.\\nI want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won\\'t have any money to leave behind. I won\\'t have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind. But I just want to leave a committed life behind.[265][272]\\nHis good friend Mahalia Jackson sang his favorite hymn, \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\", at the funeral.[273] The assassination helped to spur the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.[262]\\nTwo months after King\\'s death, James Earl Ray—on the loose from a previous prison escape—was captured at London Heathrow Airport while trying to reach white-ruled Rhodesia on a false Canadian passport. He was using the alias Ramon George Sneyd.[274] Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King\\'s murder. He confessed on March 10, 1969, though he recanted this confession three days later.[275] On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray pleaded guilty to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term.[275][276] Ray later claimed a man he met in Montreal, Quebec, with the alias \"Raoul\" was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy.[277][278] He spent the remainder of his life attempting, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had.[276] Ray died in 1998 at age 70.[279]Allegations of conspiracy\\nMain article: Martin Luther King Jr. assassination conspiracy theories\\nThe sarcophagus for Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King is within the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta, Georgia.\\nRay\\'s lawyers maintained he was a scapegoat similar to the way that John F. Kennedy\\'s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is seen by conspiracy theorists.[280] Supporters of this assertion said that Ray\\'s confession was given under pressure and that he had been threatened with the death penalty.[276][281] They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon.[278] However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for armed robbery.[282] In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. \"I never been with nobody as bold as he is,\" Jerry said. \"He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it\\'s an everyday thing.\"[282]\\nThose suspecting a conspiracy point to the two successive ballistics tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray\\'s Remington Gamemaster had been the murder weapon. Those tests did not implicate Ray\\'s specific rifle.[276][283] Witnesses near King said that the shot came from another location, from behind thick shrubbery near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window.[284] However, Ray\\'s fingerprints were found on various objects in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from.[282] An examination of the rifle containing Ray\\'s fingerprints determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm at the time of the assassination.[282]\\nIn 1997, King\\'s son Dexter Scott King met with Ray, and publicly supported Ray\\'s efforts to obtain a new trial.[285] Two years later, King\\'s widow Coretta Scott King and the couple\\'s children, represented by William F. Pepper,[286] won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and \"other unknown co-conspirators\". Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King\\'s assassination. The jury found Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy and that government agencies were party to the assassination.[287][288]\\xa0\\nIn 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice completed the investigation into Jowers\\' claims but did not find evidence of conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless new reliable facts are presented.[289] A sister of Jowers admitted that he had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she corroborated his story to get money to pay her income tax.[290][291]\\nIn 2002, The New York Times reported that a church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated King. He stated, \"It wasn\\'t a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.\" Wilson provided no evidence to back up his claims.[292]\\nKing researchers David Garrow and Gerald Posner disagreed with Pepper\\'s claims that the government killed King.[293] In 2003, Pepper published a book about the investigation and trial, as well as his representation of James Earl Ray in his bid for a trial.[294][295] James Bevel also disputed the argument that Ray acted alone, stating, \"There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man.\"[296] In 2004, Jesse Jackson stated:The fact is there were saboteurs to disrupt the march. And within our own organization, we found a very key person who was on the government payroll. So infiltration within, saboteurs from without and the press attacks.\\xa0... I will never believe that James Earl Ray had the motive, the money and the mobility to have done it himself. Our government was very involved in setting the stage for and I think the escape route for James Earl Ray.[297]\\nLegacy\\nSee also: Memorials to Martin Luther King Jr. and List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.\\nMartin Luther King Jr. statue over the west entrance of Westminster Abbey, installed in 1998\\nSouth Africa\\nSee also: Black Consciousness Movement\\nKing\\'s legacy includes influences on the Black Consciousness Movement and civil rights movement in South Africa.[298][299] King\\'s work was cited by, and served as, an inspiration for South African leader Albert Luthuli, who fought for racial justice in his country during apartheid and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[300]United Kingdom\\nSee also: Northern Ireland civil rights movement\\nJohn Hume, the former leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, cited King\\'s legacy as quintessential to the Northern Ireland civil rights movement and the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, calling him \"one of my great heroes of the century\".[301][302][303]\\nThe Martin Luther King Fund and Foundation in the UK was set up as a charity[304] on December 30, 1969, after King\\'s assassination and following a visit to the UK in 1969 by his widow, Coretta King. The Foundation\\'s first chairman, Canon John Collins, stated that the Foundation was to be an active UK national campaign for racial equality, its work also to include community projects in areas of social need, and education.[305] International Personnel (IP), an employment agency, was formed in 1970 out of the foundation\\'s base in Balham, to find employment for professionally qualified black people. In its first year, the agency placed ten percent of its applicants in jobs equal to their ability.[306] The Balham Training Scheme operated an evening school with lecturers in Typing, Shorthand, English and Math.[305] The foundation was removed from the Charity Commission list on November 18, 1996, as it had ceased to exist.[304]\\nThe Northumbria and Newcastle Universities Martin Luther King Peace Committee[307] still exists to honor King\\'s legacy, as represented by his final visit to the UK to receive an honorary degree from Newcastle University in 1967.[308][309] Northumbria and Newcastle remain centers for the study of Martin Luther King and the US civil rights movement. Inspired by King\\'s vision, the committee undertakes a range of activities across the UK to \"build cultures of peace\".\\nIn 2017, Newcastle University unveiled a bronze statue of King to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his honorary doctorate ceremony.[310] The Students Union also voted to rename their bar \"Luther\\'s\".[311]United States\\nBanner at the 2012 Republican National Convention\\nKing has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism.[312] His main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King\\'s assassination, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968.[313] Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King\\'s struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination.[313] The day following King\\'s assassination, teacher Jane Elliott conducted her first \"Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes\" exercise with her class of elementary school students to help them understand King\\'s death as it related to racism.[314]\\nKing\\'s wife Coretta Scott King was active in matters of social justice and civil rights until her death in 2006. The same year that King was assassinated, she established the King Center in Atlanta, Georgia, dedicated to preserving his legacy and the work of championing nonviolent conflict resolution and tolerance worldwide.[315] Their son, Dexter King, serves as the center\\'s chairman.[316][317] Daughter Yolanda King, who died in 2007, was a motivational speaker, author and founder of Higher Ground Productions, an organization specializing in diversity training.[318]\\nWithin the King family, members disagree about his views about LGBT people. King\\'s widow Coretta publicly said that she believed her husband would have supported gay rights.[319] However, his youngest child, Bernice King, has said that he would have been opposed to gay marriage.[320]Martin Luther King Jr. Day\\nMain article: Martin Luther King Jr. Day\\nBeginning in 1971, cities and states established annual holidays to honor King.[321] On November 2, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor King. Observed for the first time on January 20, 1986, it is called Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Following President George H. W. Bush\\'s 1992 proclamation, the holiday is observed on the third Monday of January each year, near the time of King\\'s birthday.[322][323] On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was officially observed in all fifty U.S. states.[324] Arizona (1992), New Hampshire (1999) and Utah (2000) were the last states to recognize the holiday. Utah previously celebrated the holiday under the name Human Rights Day.[325]Veneration\\nMartin Luther King of GeorgiaPastor and MartyrHonored\\xa0inHoly Christian Orthodox ChurchEpiscopal Church (United States)Evangelical Lutheran Church in AmericaCanonizedSeptember 9, 2016, The Christian Cathedral by Timothy Paul BaymonFeastApril 4January 15 (Episcopalian and Lutheran)\\nKing was canonized by Archbishop Timothy Paul of the Holy Christian Orthodox Church on September 9, 2016.[326][327][328][329][330] His feast day was set as April 4, the date of his assassination. King is also honored with a Lesser Feast on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church[331] on April 4 or January 15, the anniversary of his birth. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates King liturgically on January 15.[332]Ideas, influences, and political stances\\nChristianity\\nKing at the 1963 Civil Rights March in Washington, D.C.\\nAs a Christian minister, King\\'s main influence was Jesus Christ and the Christian gospels, which he would almost always quote in his speeches. King\\'s faith was strongly based in the Golden Rule, loving God above all, and loving your enemies. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to turn the other cheek in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus\\' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52).[333] In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus\\' \"extremist\" love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors. In another sermon, he stated:Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry. I don\\'t plan to run for any political office. I don\\'t plan to do anything but remain a preacher. And what I\\'m doing in this struggle, along with many others, grows out of my feeling that the preacher must be concerned about the whole man.[334][335]\\nKing\\'s private writings show that he rejected biblical literalism; he described the Bible as \"mythological\", doubted that Jesus was born of a virgin and did not believe that the story of Jonah and the whale was true.[336]\\nAmong the thinkers who influeced King\\'s theological outlook were L. Harold DeWolf, Edgar Brightman, Peter Bertocci, Walter George Muelder, Walter Rauschenbusch, and Reinhold Niebuhr.[337]The Measure of a Man\\nIn 1959, King published a short book called The Measure of a Man, which contained his sermons \"What is Man?\" and \"The Dimensions of a Complete Life\". The sermons argued for man\\'s need for God\\'s love and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization.[338]Nonviolence\\nKing worked alongside Quakers such as Bayard Rustin to develop nonviolent tactics.\\nWorld peace through nonviolent means is neither absurd nor unattainable. All other methods have failed. Thus we must begin anew. Nonviolence is a good starting point. Those of us who believe in this method can be voices of reason, sanity, and understanding amid the voices of violence, hatred, and emotion. We can very well set a mood of peace out of which a system of peace can be built.\\n—Martin Luther King Jr.[339]African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin was King\\'s first regular advisor on nonviolence.[340] King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley.[341] Rustin and Smiley came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Mahatma Gandhi\\'s teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s,[342] and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.[341]\\nKing initially knew little about Gandhi and rarely used the term \"nonviolence\" during his early activism. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns to defend against possible attackers. The pacifists showing him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.[343][344]\\nIn a chapter of Stride Toward Freedom, King outlined his understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat him. The chapter draws from an address by Wofford, with Rustin and Stanley Levison also providing guidance and ghostwriting.[345]\\nKing was inspired by Gandhi and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as being one of the \"individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God\".[346] King had \"for a long time\\xa0... wanted to take a trip to India.\"[347] With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959.[348][349] The trip deepened his understanding of nonviolent resistance and his commitment to America\\'s struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, \"Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.\"\\nWhen receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King hailed the \"successful precedent\" of using nonviolence \"in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might of the British Empire\\xa0... He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage.\"[350]\\nAnother influence for King\\'s nonviolent method was Henry David Thoreau\\'s essay On Civil Disobedience and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system.[351] He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich,[352] and said that Walter Rauschenbusch\\'s Christianity and the Social Crisis left an \"indelible imprint\" on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns.[353][354] King was moved by Rauschenbusch\\'s vision of Christians spreading social unrest in \"perpetual but friendly conflict\" with the state, simultaneously critiquing it and calling it to act as an instrument of justice.[355] However, he was apparently unaware of the American tradition of Christian pacifism exemplified by Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison.[356] King frequently referred to Jesus\\' Sermon on the Mount as central for his work.[354][357][358][359] Before 1960, King also sometimes used the concept of \"agape\" (brotherly Christian love).[360][361]\\nEven after renouncing personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary.[362] Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson,[363] Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.[364][365]Criticism within the movement\\nKing was criticized by other black leaders in the civil rights movement. This included more militant thinkers such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X.[366] Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Ella Baker regarded King as a charismatic media figure who lost touch with the grassroots of the movement[367] as he became close to elite figures like Nelson Rockefeller.[368] Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker\\'s, became a black separatist and disagreed with King\\'s plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture.[369][370] He also took issue that King\\'s non-violence approach depended on appealing to America\\'s conscience, feeling America had none to appeal to.[371]Activism and involvement with Native Americans\\nKing was an avid supporter of Native American rights and Native Americans were active supporters of King\\'s civil rights movement.[372] The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) was patterned after the NAACP\\'s Legal Defense and Education Fund.[373] The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was especially supportive in King\\'s campaigns especially the Poor People\\'s Campaign in 1968.[374] In King\\'s book Why We Can\\'t Wait he writes:Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.[375]\\nIn the late 1950, the remaining Creek in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools. Light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride buses to previously all-white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from the same buses.[373] Tribal leaders, hearing of King\\'s desegregation campaign in Birmingham, contacted him for assistance. Through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.[373]\\nIn September 1959, after giving a speech at the University of Arizona on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change, King stated his belief that one must not use force in this struggle \"but match the violence of his opponents with his suffering.\"[376] King then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by their photos; he wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Casper Glenn took King to the Papago Indian Reservation.[376] He met with all the tribal leaders, visited another Presbyterian church near the reservation, and preached there, attracting a Native American crowd.[376] He later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where he preached again to a Native American congregation.[376] King would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the 1963 March on Washington there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota and from the Navajo nation.[373][377]\\nKing was a major inspiration, along with the civil rights movement, of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s and many of its leaders.[373] John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe who was the executive director and a founder of the Native American Rights Fund, stated:Inspired by Dr. King, who was advancing the civil rights agenda of equality under the laws of this country, we thought that we could also use the laws to advance our Indianship, to live as tribes in our territories governed by our own laws under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with us ever since 1831. We believed that we could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that we could govern our own affairs, define our own ways and continue to survive in this society.[378]\\nPolitics\\nAs the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: \"I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either.\"[379] In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, \"I don\\'t think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses\\xa0... And I\\'m not inextricably bound to either party.\"[380] King did praise Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois as being the \"greatest of all senators\" because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes.[381]\\nKing critiqued both parties\\' performance on promoting racial equality:Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right-wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right-wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.[382]\\nAlthough King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he had not decided whether he would vote for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II or Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1956 presidential election, but that \"In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket.\"[383] In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: \"I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one.\" King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying \"Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964.\"[384]\\nIn 1964, King urged his supporters \"and all people of goodwill\" to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election \"would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.\"[385] King believed Robert F. Kennedy would make for a good president, but also believed that he wouldn\\'t beat Johnson in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He also expressed support for the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Charles Percy. [386]\\nKing rejected both laissez-faire capitalism and communism; King had read Marx while at Morehouse but rejected communism because of its \"materialistic interpretation of history\" that denied religion, its \"ethical relativism\", and its \"political totalitarianism\". He stated that one focused too much on the individual while the other focused too much on the collective.[387] The American philosopher Tommie Shelby has described King as a social democrat who advocated for advocating economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal-democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented mixed economy.[388] However, he was often reluctant to speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of social democratic (\"socialist\") movements with communism. King believed that a laissez-faire economic system would not adequately provide the necessities of many American people, particularly African Americans.[226]\\nIn a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, he said: \"I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic\\xa0...\"[389][390] In one speech, he stated that \"something is wrong with capitalism\" and said, \"There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\"[391] King further said that \"capitalism has outlived its usefulness\" and \"failed to meet the needs of the masses\".[392]Compensation\\nSee also: Reparations for slavery debate in the United States\\nKing stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50\\xa0billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.[393]\\nHe posited that \"the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.\"[394] He presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, \"It should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.\"[395]Television\\nActress Nichelle Nichols planned to leave the science-fiction television series Star Trek in 1967 after its first season.[396] She changed her mind after talking to King,[397] who was a fan of the show. King explained that her character signified a future of greater racial cooperation.[398] King told Nichols, \"You are our image of where we\\'re going, you\\'re 300 years from now, and that means that\\'s where we are and it takes place now. Keep doing what you\\'re doing, you are our inspiration.\"[399] As Nichols recounted: Star Trek was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow their little children to watch. And I thanked him and I told him I was leaving the show. All the smile came off his face. And he said, \\'Don\\'t you understand for the first time we\\'re seen as we should be seen. You don\\'t have a black role. You have an equal role.\\'[396] The series\\' creator, Gene Roddenberry, was deeply moved upon learning of King\\'s support.[400]\\nState surveillance and coercion\\nFBI surveillance and wiretapping\\nMemo describing FBI attempts to disrupt the Poor People\\'s Campaign with fraudulent claims about King\\u200d—\\u200cpart of the COINTELPRO campaign against the anti-war and civil rights movements\\nFBI director J. Edgar Hoover personally ordered surveillance of King, with the intent to undermine his power as a civil rights leader.[401][402] The Church Committee, a 1975 investigation by the U.S. Congress, found that \"From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to \\'neutralize\\' him as an effective civil rights leader.\"[403]\\nIn the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to proceed with wiretapping of King\\'s phone lines, purportedly due to his association with Stanley Levison.[404] The Bureau informed President John F. Kennedy. He and his brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from Levison, a New York lawyer who had been involved with Communist Party USA.[405][406] Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King\\'s telephone lines \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\",[407] Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King\\'s life they deemed worthy.[114]\\nThe Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Levison and King, and bugged King\\'s rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country.[405][408] In 1967, Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: \"No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups\\xa0... to insure  [sic] the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited.\"[402][409]NSA monitoring of King\\'s communications\\nIn a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who were critical of the U.S. war in Vietnam.[410] A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was \"disreputable if not outright illegal\".[410]Allegations of communism\\nFor years, Hoover had been suspicious of potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights.[411] Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC when it was established.[3]\\nDue to the relationship between King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Levison was working as an \"agent of influence\" over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them.[412] Another King lieutenant, Jack O\\'Dell, was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).[413]\\nDespite the extensive surveillance, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.[403]\\nFor his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 Playboy interview, he stated that \"there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.\"[414] He argued that Hoover was \"following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South\" and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to \"aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements.\"[403] Hoover replied by saying that King was \"the most notorious liar in the country\".[415] After his \"I Have A Dream\" speech, the FBI described King as \"the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country\".[408] It alleged that he was \"knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists.\"[416]\\nThe attempts to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo but had been stirred up by \"communists\" and \"outside agitators\".[417] King said that \"the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals—the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations.\"[418]CIA surveillance\\nCIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation.[419] Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program HTLINGUAL.[420]Allegations of adultery\\nThe only meeting of King and Malcolm X, outside the United States Senate chamber, March 26, 1964, during the Senate debates regarding the (eventual) Civil Rights Act of 1964[421]\\nThe FBI attempted to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he had numerous extramarital affairs.[408] The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King\\'s family.[422] The bureau also sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information if he did not cease his civil rights work.[423] The FBI–King suicide letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part:The FBI–King suicide letter,[424] mailed anonymously by the FBI\\nThe American public, the church organizations that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant  [sic]). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.[425]\\nThe letter was accompanied by a tape recording—excerpted from FBI wiretaps—of several of King\\'s extramarital liaisons.[426] King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide,[427] although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to \"convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC.\"[403] King refused to succumb to the FBI\\'s threats.[408]\\nIn 1977, Judge John Lewis Smith Jr. ordered the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI\\'s electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to sealed from public access in the National Archives until 2027.[428]In May 2019, an FBI file emerged on which a handwritten note alleged that King \"looked on, laughed and offered advice\" as one of his friends raped a woman. Historians of the period who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed it as highly unreliable.[429][430] David Garrow, author of an earlier biography of King, wrote that \"the suggestion ... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible\".[431][430] Garrow\\'s reliance on a handwritten note addended to a typed report is considered poor scholarship by several other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that Garrow was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of FBI reports during a period when the FBI was undertaking a massive operation to attempt to discredit King.[432] Experts in 20th-century American history, including Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis, the professors Barbara Ransby of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Nathan Connolly of Johns Hopkins University and Professor Emeritus of History Glenda Gilmore of Yale University have expressed reservations about Garrow\\'s scholarship. Theoharis commented \"Most scholars I know would penalize graduate students for doing this.\" It is not the first time the care and rigor of Garrow\\'s work has been called into serious question.[430] Clayborne Carson, Martin Luther King biographer and overseer of the Dr. King records at Stanford University states that he came to the opposite conclusion of Garrow: None of this is new. Garrow is talking about a recently added summary of a transcript of a 1964 recording from the Willard Hotel that others, including Mrs. King, have said they did not hear Martin\\'s voice on it. The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report. You have to ask how could anyone conclude King looked at a rape from an audio recording in a room where he was not present.[433] The tapes that could confirm or refute the allegation are scheduled to be declassified in 2027.[434]\\nIn his 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down, Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a \"weakness for women\", although they \"all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.\"[435] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term \"womanizing\", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual.[436] Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King\\'s affairs,[436] such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.[436]\\nIn his 1986 book Bearing the Cross, David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, \"that relationship\\xa0... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King\\'s life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings\\xa0... of King\\'s travels.\" He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as \"a form of anxiety reduction\". Garrow asserted that King\\'s supposed promiscuity caused him \"painful and at times overwhelming guilt\".[437] King\\'s wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that \"all that other business just doesn\\'t have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.\"[438] Shortly after Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow\\'s allegations about King\\'s sex life were \"sensational\" and stated that Garrow was \"amassing facts rather than analyzing them\".[439]Police observation during the assassination\\nA fire station was located across from the Lorraine Motel, next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying. Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance.[440] Agents were watching King at the time he was shot.[441] Immediately following the shooting, officers rushed to the motel. Marrell McCollough, an undercover police officer, was the first person to administer first aid to King.[442] The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.[443]Awards and recognition\\nKing showing his medallion, which he received from Mayor Wagner, 1964\\nKing was awarded at least fifty honorary degrees from colleges and universities.[444] On October 14, 1964, King became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to him for leading nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in the U.S.[445][446] In 1965, he was awarded the American Liberties Medallion by the American Jewish Committee for his \"exceptional advancement of the principles of human liberty.\"[444][447] In his acceptance remarks, King said, \"Freedom is one thing. You have it all or you are not free.\"[448]\\nIn 1957, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP.[449] Two years later, he won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story.[450] In 1966, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America awarded King the Margaret Sanger Award for \"his courageous resistance to bigotry and his lifelong dedication to the advancement of social justice and human dignity.\"[451] Also in 1966, King was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[452] In November 1967, he made a 24-hour trip to the UK to receive an honorary Doctorate in Civil Law from Newcastle University, becoming the first African American the institution had recognized in this way.[309] In an impromptu acceptance speech,[308] he said:There are three urgent and indeed great problems that we face not only in the United States of America but all over the world today. That is the problem of racism, the problem of poverty and the problem of war.\\nKing after receiving his honorary doctorate from Newcastle University\\nIn addition to his nominations for three Grammy Awards, King posthumously won for Best Spoken Word Recording in 1971 for \"Why I Oppose The War In Vietnam\".[453]\\nIn 1977, President Jimmy Carter posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to King. The citation read:Martin Luther King Jr. was the conscience of his generation. He gazed upon the great wall of segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.[454]\\nKing and his wife were also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004.[455]\\nKing was second in Gallup\\'s List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century.[456] In 1963, he was named Time Person of the Year, and, in 2000, he was voted sixth in an online \"Person of the Century\" poll by the same magazine.[457] King placed third in The Greatest American conducted by the Discovery Channel and AOL.[458]Five-dollar bill\\nOn April 20, 2016, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew announced that the $5, $10, and $20 bills would all undergo redesign prior to 2020. Lew said that while Lincoln would remain on the front of the $5 bill, the reverse would be redesigned to depict various historical events that had occurred at the Lincoln Memorial. Among the planned designs are images from King\\'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech.[459]Memorials\\nMain article: List of memorials to Martin Luther King Jr.\\nMany memorial sites, buildings and sculptures have been created to honor Martin Luther King Jr, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, D.C.,[460] the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Library in San Jose, California, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in West Potomac Park next to the National Mall in Washington, D.C.Honorary doctorates\\nKing has received several honorary doctorates.[461]1957: Doctor of Humane Letters, Morehouse College; Doctor of Laws, Howard University; Doctor of Divinity, Chicago Theological Seminary\\n1958: Doctor of Laws, Morgan State College; Doctor of Humanities, Central State College\\n1959: Doctor of Divinity, Boston University\\n1961: Doctor of Laws, Lincoln University; Doctor of Laws, University of Bridgeport\\n1962: Doctor of Civil Laws, Bard College\\n1963: Doctor of Letters, Keuka College\\n1964: Doctor of Divinity, Wesleyan College; Doctor of Laws, Jewish Theological Seminary; Doctor of Laws, Yale University; Doctor of Divinity, Springfield College\\n1965: Doctor of Laws, Hofstra University; Doctor of Humane Letters, Oberlin College; Doctor of Social Science, Amsterdam Free University; Doctor of Divinity, St. Peter\\'s College\\n1967: Doctor of Civil Law, University of Newcastle upon Tyne; Doctor of Laws, Grinnell College\\nWorks\\nStride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story (1958) ISBN\\xa0978-0-06-250490-6\\nThe Measure of a Man (1959) ISBN\\xa0978-0-8006-0877-4\\nStrength to Love (1963) ISBN\\xa0978-0-8006-9740-2\\nWhy We Can\\'t Wait (1964) ISBN\\xa0978-0-8070-0112-7\\nWhere Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?

Oates (1993) and Schuman (2014) state that King passed the exam in the spring of 1944 before graduating from the eleventh grade and then being enrolled in Morehouse that fall. Manheimer (2005) states that King graduated from the eleventh grade, then applied and took the entrance exam before going to Connecticut, but did not find out he had passed until August 1944 when he was admitted. White (1974) states he took and passed the exam upon his return from Connecticut in 1944.^ Though commonly attributed to King, this expression originated with 19th-century abolitionist Theodore Parker.[189]\\nCitations\\n^ a b c Jackson 2006, p.\\xa053.^ a b Glisson 2006, p.\\xa0190.^ a b c Theoharis, Athan G.; Poveda, Tony G.; Powers, Richard Gid; Rosenfeld, Susan (1999).

      "Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Christian minister, activist, and political philosopher who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and other forms of legalized discrimination. \n",
      "King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights.[1] He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the 1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n",
      "The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently.[2] King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.[3]\n",
      "On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance.  In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was convicted of the assassination, though the King family believes he was a scapegoat; the assassination remains the subject of conspiracy theories. King's death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n",
      "Early life and education\n",
      "Birth\n",
      "King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams).[4][5][6] King had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel \"A. D.\" King.[7] Alberta's father, Adam Daniel Williams,[8] was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893,[6] and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year.[9] Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks.[6] King Sr. was born to sharecroppers James Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia,[5][6] and was of African-Irish descent.[10][11][12] As an adolescent, King Sr. left his parents' farm and walked to Atlanta, where he attained a high school education,[13][14][15] and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry.[15] King Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926.[16][17] Until Jennie's death in 1941, they lived together on the second floor of Alberta's parents' Victorian house, where King was born.[18][16][17][19]\n",
      "Shortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church.[17] Senior pastor Williams died in the spring of 1931[17] and, that fall, King Sr. took the role. With support from his wife, he would raise attendance from six hundred to several thousand.[6][17][20] In 1934, the church sent King Sr. on a multinational trip, including to Berlin for the Congress of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA).[21] He also visited sites in Germany that were associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther.[21] In reaction to the rise of Nazism, the BWA issued a resolution stating, \"This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world.\"[22] On returning home in August 1934, King Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son's name to Martin Luther King Jr.[21][23][16][a]Early childhood\n",
      "King's childhood home in Atlanta, Georgia\n",
      "At his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father.[25] After dinners, King's grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as \"Mama\", would tell lively stories from the Bible.[25] King's father would regularly use whippings to discipline his children,[26] sometimes having them whip each other.[26] King's father later remarked, \"[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He'd stand there, and the tears would run down, and he'd never cry.\"[27] Once, when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it.[26][28] When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive.[29][28] King, believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window,[30][28] but rose from the ground on hearing that she was alive.[30]\n",
      "King became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his home.[31] In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school.[31][32] King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School,[31][33] while his playmate went to a separate school for white children only.[31][33] Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, \"we are white, and you are colored\".[31][34] When King relayed this to his parents, they discussed with him the history of slavery and racism in America,[31][35] which King would later state made him \"determined to hate every white person\".[31] His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.[35]\n",
      "King witnessed his father stand up against segregation and discrimination.[36] Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as \"boy\", King's father responded sharply that King Jr. was a boy but he was a man.[36] When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back.[37] King's father refused, stating \"we'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all\", before leaving the store with King.[14] He told King afterward, \"I don't care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.\"[14] In 1936, King's father led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination.[26] King later remarked that King Sr. was \"a real father\" to him.[38]\n",
      "King memorized hymns and Bible verses by the time he was five years old.[30] Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing hymns while she played piano.[30] His favorite hymn was \"I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus\"; he moved attendees with his singing.[30] King later became a member of the junior choir in his church.[39] King enjoyed opera, and played the piano.[40] King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries.[28] He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stymie fights.[28][40] King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait that persisted throughout his life.[40] In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir in slave costume, for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film Gone with the Wind.[41][42] In September 1940, at the age of 11, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the seventh grade.[43][44] While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and showed keen interest in history and English classes.[43]\n",
      "On May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother.[38] Upon returning home, he learned she had a heart attack and died while being transported to a hospital.[19] He took the death very hard and believed that his deception of going to see the parade may have been responsible for God taking her.[19] King jumped out of a second-story window at his home, but again survived.[19][27][28] His father instructed him that King should not blame himself, and that she had been called home to God as part of God's plan.[19][45] King struggled with this.[19] Shortly thereafter, King's father decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta.[19]Adolescence\n",
      "The high school that King attended was named after African-American educator Booker T. Washington.\n",
      "As an adolescent, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the \"racial humiliation\" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure.[46] In 1942, when King was 13, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal.[47] That year, King skipped the ninth grade and was enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School, where he maintained a B-plus average.[45][48] The high school was the only one in the city for African-American students.[17]\n",
      "While King was brought up in a Baptist home, as he entered adolescence he began to question the literalist teachings preached at his father's church.[45][49] At the age of 13, he denied the bodily resurrection of Jesus during Sunday school.[50][49] King said that he found himself unable to identify with the emotional displays from congregants frequent at his church, and doubted if he would ever attain personal satisfaction from religion.[51][49] He later stated of this point in his life, \"doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly.\"[52][50][49]\n",
      "In high school, King became known for his public-speaking ability, with a voice that had grown into an orotund baritone.[53][48] He joined the school's debate team.[53][48] King continued to be most drawn to history and English,[48] and chose English and sociology as his main subjects.[54] King maintained an abundant vocabulary.[48] However, he relied on his sister Christine to help him with spelling, while King assisted her with math.[48] King also developed an interest in fashion, commonly wearing polished patent leather shoes and tweed suits, which gained him the nickname \"Tweed\" or \"Tweedie\" among his friends.[55][56][57][58] He liked flirting with girls and dancing.[57][56][59] His brother A.D. later remarked, \"He kept flitting from chick to chick, and I decided I couldn't keep up with him. Especially since he was crazy about dances, and just about the best jitterbug in town.\"[56]\n",
      "On April 13, 1944, in his junior year, King gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest.[60][56][61][62] In his speech he stated, \"black America still wears chains. The finest negro is at the mercy of the meanest white man.\"[63][60] King was selected as the winner of the contest.[60][56] On the ride home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit.[56][64] The driver of the bus called King a \"black son-of-a-bitch\".[56] King initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not.[64] As all the seats were occupied, he and his teacher were forced to stand the rest of the way to Atlanta.[56] Later King wrote of the incident: \"That night will never leave my memory. It was the angriest I have ever been in my life.\"[64]Morehouse College\n",
      "During King's junior year in high school, Morehouse College—an all-male historically black college that King's father and maternal grandfather had attended[65][66]—began accepting high school juniors who passed the entrance examination.[56][67][64] As World War II was underway many black college students had been enlisted,[56][67] so the university aimed to increase their enrolment by allowing juniors to apply.[56][67][64] In 1944, aged 15, King passed the examination and was enrolled at the university that autumn.[b][56][67][65][68]\n",
      "In the summer before King started at Morehouse, he boarded a train with his friend—Emmett \"Weasel\" Proctor—and a group of other Morehouse College students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut, at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco.[69][70] This was King's first trip into the integrated north.[71][72] In a June 1944 letter to his father King wrote about the differences that struck him: \"On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see. After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit anywhere we want to.\"[71] The farm had partnered with Morehouse College to allot their salaries towards the university's tuition, housing, and fees.[69][70] On weekdays King and the other students worked in the fields, picking tobacco from 7:00am to at least 5:00pm, enduring temperatures above 100 °F, to earn roughly USD$4 per day.[70][71] On Friday evenings, the students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to Hartford, Connecticut, to see theatre performances, shop and eat in restaurants.[70][72] On Sundays they attended church services in Hartford, at a church filled with white congregants.[70] King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation, relaying how he was amazed they could go to \"one of the finest restaurants in Hartford\" and that \"Negroes and whites go to the same church\".[70][73][71]\n",
      "He played freshman football there. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He would later credit the college's president, Baptist minister Benjamin Mays, with being his \"spiritual mentor\".[74] King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer \"an inner urge to serve humanity\", and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a \"rational\" minister with sermons that were \"a respectful force for ideas, even social protest.\"[75] King graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 1948, aged nineteen.[76]Religious education\n",
      "King received a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Crozer Theological Seminary in 1951 (pictured in 2009).\n",
      "See also: Martin Luther King Jr. authorship issues\n",
      "King enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania,[77][78] and took several courses at the University of Pennsylvania.[79][80] At Crozer, King was elected president of the student body.[81] At Penn, King took courses with William Fontaine, Penn's first African-American professor, and Elizabeth F. Flower, a professor of philosophy.[82] King's father supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with J. Pius Barbour, a family friend and Crozer alumnus who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania.[83] King became known as one of the \"Sons of Calvary\", an honor he shared with William Augustus Jones Jr. and Samuel D. Proctor, who both went on to become well-known preachers.[84]\n",
      "King once reproved another student for keeping beer in his room, saying they shared responsibility as African Americans to bear \"the burdens of the Negro race\". For a time, he was interested in Walter Rauschenbusch's \"social gospel\".[81] In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with[85] the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked in the cafeteria. King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King's father,[85] advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. One friend was quoted as saying, \"He never recovered.\"[81] Other friends, including Harry Belafonte, said Betty had been \"the love of King's life.\"[85] King graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity in 1951.[77] He applied to the University of Edinburgh for a doctorate in the School of Divinity but ultimately chose Boston instead.[86]\n",
      "In 1951, King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University,[87] and worked as an assistant minister at Boston's historic Twelfth Baptist Church with William Hunter Hester. Hester was an old friend of King's father and was an important influence on King.[88] In Boston, King befriended a small cadre of local ministers his age, and sometimes guest pastored at their churches, including Michael Haynes, associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. The young men often held bull sessions in their apartments, discussing theology, sermon style, and social issues.\n",
      "At the age of 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.[89] King received his PhD on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation (initially supervised by Edgar S. Brightman and, upon the latter's death, by Lotan Harold DeWolf) titled A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.[90][87]\n",
      "An academic inquiry in October 1991 concluded that portions of his doctoral dissertation had been plagiarized and he had acted improperly. However, \"[d]espite its finding, the committee said that 'no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King's doctoral degree,' an action that the panel said would serve no purpose.\"[91][87][92] The committee found that the dissertation still \"makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship.\" A letter is now attached to the copy of King's dissertation in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources.[93] Significant debate exists on how to interpret King's plagiarism.[94]Marriage and family\n",

Powell spoke to fellow student Coretta Scott; Scott was not interested in dating preachers but eventually agreed to allow King to telephone her based on Powell's description and vouching. On their first call, King told Scott, \"I am like Napoleon at Waterloo before your charms,\" to which she replied, \"You haven't even met me.\" King married Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house, in Heiberger, Alabama.[95] They had four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b. 1957), Dexter Scott King (1961–2024), and Bernice King (b. 1963).[96] King limited Coretta's role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.[97]Activism and organizational leadership\n",

      "In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation.[99] Nine months later on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus.[100] The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Edgar Nixon and led by King.[101] The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant but decided to do so if no one else wanted it.[102]\n",
      "The boycott lasted for 385 days,[103] and the situation became so tense that King's house was bombed.[104] King was arrested for traveling 30 mph in a 25 mph zone[105] and jailed, which overnight drew the attention of national media, and greatly increased King's public stature.

      "Southern Christian Leadership Conference\n",
      "In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King,[108] as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker.[109] King led the SCLC until his death.[110] The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.[111]\n",
      "Harry Wachtel joined King's legal advisor Clarence B. Jones in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case Abernathy et al. v. Sullivan; the case was litigated about the newspaper advertisement \"Heed Their Rising Voices\". Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit's expenses and assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. King served as honorary president of this organization, named the \"Gandhi Society for Human Rights\". In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on President Kennedy to issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order.[112] The FBI, under written directive from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, began tapping King's telephone line in the fall of 1963.[113] Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.[114] FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years, as part of its COINTELPRO program, in attempts to force King out of his leadership position.[3]\n",
      "King believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights supporters, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.[115][116]\n",
      "King organized and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights.[1] Most of these rights were successfully enacted into law with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.[117][118]\n",
      "The SCLC used tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.[2]Survived knife attack, 1958\n",
      "On September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book Stride Toward Freedom in Blumstein's department store in Harlem[119] when Izola Curry—a mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communists—stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, which nearly impinged on the aorta. King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano.[120] King underwent emergency surgery by Aubre de Lambert Maynard, Emil Naclerio and John W. V. Cordice; he remained hospitalized for several weeks. Curry was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial.[121][122]Atlanta sit-ins, prison sentence, and the 1960 elections\n",

      "In December 1959, after being based in Montgomery for five years, King announced his return to Atlanta at the request of the SCLC.[123] In Atlanta, King served until his death as co-pastor with his father at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver expressed open hostility towards King's return. He claimed that \"wherever M. L. King Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes\", and vowed to keep King under surveillance.[124] On May 4, 1960, King drove writer Lillian Smith to Emory University when police stopped them. King was cited for \"driving without a license\" because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license. King's Alabama license was still valid, and Georgia law did not mandate any time limit for issuing a local license.[125] King paid a fine but was unaware that his lawyer agreed to a plea deal that included probation.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Atlanta Student Movement had been acting to desegregate businesses and public spaces, organizing the Atlanta sit-ins from March 1960 onwards. In August the movement asked King to participate in a mass October sit-in, timed to highlight how 1960's Presidential election campaign had ignored civil rights. The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside Rich's, Atlanta's largest department store, and was among the many arrested that day. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except for King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor. Before dawn the next day, King was transported to Georgia State Prison.[126]\n",
      "The arrest and harsh sentence drew nationwide attention. Many feared for King's safety, as he started a prison sentence with people convicted of violent crimes, many of them White and hostile to his activism.[127] Both Presidential candidates were asked to weigh in, at a time when both parties were courting the support of Southern Whites and their political leadership including Governor Vandiver. Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship before, declined to make a statement despite a personal visit from Jackie Robinson requesting his intervention. Nixon's opponent John F. Kennedy called the governor (a Democrat) directly, enlisted his brother Robert to exert more pressure on state authorities, and, at the personal request of Sargent Shriver, called King's wife to offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later. King's father decided to openly endorse Kennedy's candidacy for the November 8 election which he narrowly won.[128]\n",
      "After the October 19 sit-ins and following unrest, a 30-day truce was declared in Atlanta for desegregation negotiations. However, the negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city's lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools.[129][130] Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a large meeting on March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated. King then gave an impassioned speech calling participants to resist the \"cancerous disease of disunity\", helping to calm tensions.[131]Albany Movement, 1961\n",
      "Main article: Albany Movement\n",
      "The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany, Georgia, in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation in the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he \"had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel.\"[132] The following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, \"that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city\" after he left.[132]\n",
      "King returned in July 1962 and was given the option of forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine (equivalent to $1,700 in 2022); he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. \"We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools ... ejected from churches ... and thrown into jail ... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail.\"[133] It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out.[134]\n",
      "After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a \"Day of Penance\" to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts.[135] Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement,[136] the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.[137]Vice President Lyndon B.

      "In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Wyatt Tee Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.\n",
      "King's intent was to provoke mass arrests and \"create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.\"[139] The campaign's early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police's actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist James Bevel changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join the demonstrations.[140] Newsweek called this strategy a Children's Crusade.[141][142]\n",
      "The Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement.[143] Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm's way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the \"Jim Crow\" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King's reputation improved immensely.[141]\n",
      "King was arrested and jailed early in the campaign—his 13th arrest[144] out of 29.[145] From his cell, he composed the now-famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" that responds to calls to pursue legal channels for social change. The letter has been described as \"one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner\".[146] King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: \"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\"[147] He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, \"everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal'.\"[147] Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged for $160,000 to bail out King and his fellow protestors.[148]\"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\"\n",

However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed.[156] With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000 and enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators.[157]The March, a 1964 documentary film produced by the United States Information Agency.

      "The march originally was planned to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.[158] As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the \"Farce on Washington\", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending.[158][159]King gave his most famous speech, \"I Have a Dream\", before the Lincoln Memorial during the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.I Have a Dream30-second sample from \"I Have a Dream\" speech by Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963\n",

At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.[163]\n",

      "I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.\n",
      "\"I Have a Dream\" came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory.[167] The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[168][169]\n",

This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965.[183] During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.\n",
      "Acting on James Bevel's call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Bevel and other SCLC members, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel's nonviolence strategy.[52]\n",
      "On March 5, King met with officials in the Johnson Administration to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, \"If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.\"[184] Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.[185]\n",
      "King next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement.[186] The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.[187][188] At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as \"How Long, Not Long\".

Daley to cancel a march in order to avoid the violence that he feared would result.[200] King was hit by a brick during one march, but continued to lead marches in the face of personal danger.[201]\n",
      "When King and his allies returned to the South, they left Jesse Jackson, a seminary student who had previously joined the movement in the South, in charge of their organization.[202] Jackson continued their struggle for civil rights by organizing the Operation Breadbasket movement that targeted chain stores that did not deal fairly with blacks.[203]\n",

It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society. It reveals systemic rather than superficial flaws and suggests that radical reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced\n",
      "–Martin Luther King Jr.[205]We must recognize that we can't solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power... this means a revolution of values and other things. We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation, and militarism are all tied together… you can't really get rid of one without getting rid of the others… the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.\n",
      "—Martin Luther King Jr.[206]See also: Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War\n",
      "King was long opposed to American involvement in the Vietnam War,[207] but at first avoided the topic in public speeches to avoid the interference with civil rights goals that criticism of President Johnson's policies might have created.[207] At the urging of SCLC's former Director of Direct Action and now the head of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, James Bevel, and inspired by the outspokenness of Muhammad Ali,[208] King eventually agreed to publicly oppose the war as opposition was growing among the American public.[207]\n",
      "During an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church, King delivered a speech titled \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence\".[209] He spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, arguing that the U.S. was in Vietnam \"to occupy it as an American colony\"[210] and calling the U.S. government \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today\".[211] He connected the war with economic injustice, arguing that the country needed serious moral change:A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: \"This is not just.\"[212] \n",
      "King opposed the Vietnam War because it took money and resources that could have been spent on social welfare at home. He summed up this aspect by saying, \"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\"[212] He stated that North Vietnam \"did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands\",[213] and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, \"mostly children\".[214] King also criticized American opposition to North Vietnam's land reforms.[215]\n",
      "King's opposition cost him significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, Billy Graham, union leaders and powerful publishers.[216][217][218] \"The press is being stacked against me\", King said,[219] complaining of what he described as a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied \"toward little brown Vietnamese children\".[220] Life magazine called the speech \"demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi\",[212] and The Washington Post declared that King had \"diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.\"[220][221]King speaking to an anti-Vietnam war rally at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul on April 27, 1967\n",
      "The \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech reflected King's evolving political advocacy in his later years, which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center, with which he was affiliated.[222][223] King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the American political and economic situation, and more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct injustice.[224][225] He guarded his language in public to avoid being linked to communism, but in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism.[226][227]\n",
      "King stated in \"Beyond Vietnam\" that \"true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\"[228] King quoted a U.S. official who said that from Vietnam to Latin America, the country was \"on the wrong side of a world revolution.\"[228] King condemned America's \"alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America\", and said that the U.S. should support \"the shirtless and barefoot people\" in the Third World rather than suppressing their attempts at revolution.[228]\n",
      "King's stance on Vietnam encouraged Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, with the support of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal as he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited to activism.[229]\n",
      "On April 15, 1967, King spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan's Central Park to the United Nations. The march was organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam under chairman James Bevel. At the U.N. King brought up issues of civil rights and the draft:I have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements. There are people who have come to see the moral imperative of equality, but who cannot yet see the moral imperative of world brotherhood. I would like to see the fervor of the civil-rights movement imbued into the peace movement to instill it with greater strength. And I believe everyone has a duty to be in both the civil-rights and peace movements. But for those who presently choose but one, I would hope they will finally come to see the moral roots common to both.[230]\n",
      "Seeing an opportunity to unite civil rights and anti-war activists,[208] Bevel convinced King to become even more active in the anti-war effort.[208] Despite his growing public opposition to the Vietnam War, King was not fond of the hippie culture which developed from the anti-war movement.[231] In his 1967 Massey Lecture, King stated:The importance of the hippies is not in their unconventional behavior, but in the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people, in turning to a flight from reality, are expressing a profoundly discrediting view on the society they emerge from.[231]\n",
      "On January 13, 1968, King called for a large march on Washington against \"one of history's most cruel and senseless wars\":[232][233]We need to make clear in this political year, to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the United States, that we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killings of Vietnamese and Americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self-determination in Southeast Asia.[232][233]\n",

      "Thích Nhất Hạnh was an influential Vietnamese Buddhist who wrote a letter to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965 entitled: \"In Search of the Enemy of Man\". It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War.[234] In 1967, King gave a famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam.[235] Later that year, King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, \"I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity\".[236]Poor People's Campaign, 1968\n",

King traveled the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \"economic bill of rights\".[237][238]\n",
      "The campaign was preceded by King's final book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from Henry George's book Progress and Poverty, particularly in support of a guaranteed basic income.[239][240][241] The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the U.S.\n",
      "King and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America's cities. He felt that Congress had shown \"hostility to the poor\" by spending \"military funds with alacrity and generosity\". He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided \"poverty funds with miserliness\".[238] His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of \"racism, poverty, militarism and materialism\", and argued that \"reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced.\"[242]\n",
      "The Poor People's Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate repression on the poor and the black.[243]Global policy\n",

In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.[247][248][249]\n",
      "On April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" address at Mason Temple. King's flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane.[250] In reference to the bomb threat, King said:And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?\n",
      "Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.[251]\n",
      "King was booked in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Ralph Abernathy, who was present at the assassination, testified to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations that King and his entourage stayed at Room 306 so often that it was known as the \"King-Abernathy suite\".[252] According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King's last words were spoken to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: \"Ben, make sure you play 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\"[253]\n",

      "Further information: King assassination riots\n",
      "The assassination led to race riots in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, Louisville, Kansas City, and dozens of other cities.[260][261][262] Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign rally when he was informed of King's death. He gave a short, improvised speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King's ideal of nonviolence.[263] The following day, he delivered a prepared response in Cleveland.[264] James Farmer Jr. and other civil rights leaders also called for non-violent action, while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more forceful response.[265] The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.[266]\n",
      "The plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King's plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations to carry it out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered.[267] Thousands of demonstrators arrived on the National Mall and stayed for six weeks, establishing a camp they called \"Resurrection City\".[268]\n",
      "President Johnson tried to quell the riots by making telephone calls to civil rights leaders, mayors and governors across the United States and told politicians that they should warn the police against the unwarranted use of force.[262] However, \"I'm not getting through,\" Johnson told his aides. \"They're all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.\"[262] Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for King.[269]\n",
      "Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended King's funeral on behalf of the President, as there were fears that Johnson's presence might incite protests and perhaps violence.[270] At his widow's request, King's last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, given on February 4, 1968, was played at the funeral:[271]I'd like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I'd like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.\n",

I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won't have any money to leave behind. I won't have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind.

      "Two months after King's death, James Earl Ray—on the loose from a previous prison escape—was captured at London Heathrow Airport while trying to reach white-ruled Rhodesia on a false Canadian passport. He was using the alias Ramon George Sneyd.[274] Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder. He confessed on March 10, 1969, though he recanted this confession three days later.[275] On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray pleaded guilty to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term.[275][276] Ray later claimed a man he met in Montreal, Quebec, with the alias \"Raoul\" was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy.[277][278] He spent the remainder of his life attempting, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had.[276] Ray died in 1998 at age 70.[279]Allegations of conspiracy\n",

      "Ray's lawyers maintained he was a scapegoat similar to the way that John F. Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is seen by conspiracy theorists.[280] Supporters of this assertion said that Ray's confession was given under pressure and that he had been threatened with the death penalty.[276][281] They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon.[278] However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for armed robbery.[282] In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. \"I never been with nobody as bold as he is,\" Jerry said. \"He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it's an everyday thing.\"[282]\n",
      "Those suspecting a conspiracy point to the two successive ballistics tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray's Remington Gamemaster had been the murder weapon. Those tests did not implicate Ray's specific rifle.[276][283] Witnesses near King said that the shot came from another location, from behind thick shrubbery near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window.[284] However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from.[282] An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm at the time of the assassination.[282]\n",
      "In 1997, King's son Dexter Scott King met with Ray, and publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a new trial.[285] Two years later, King's widow Coretta Scott King and the couple's children, represented by William F. Pepper,[286] won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and \"other unknown co-conspirators\". Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King's assassination. The jury found Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy and that government agencies were party to the assassination.[287][288] \n",
      "In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice completed the investigation into Jowers' claims but did not find evidence of conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless new reliable facts are presented.[289] A sister of Jowers admitted that he had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she corroborated his story to get money to pay her income tax.[290][291]\n",
      "In 2002, The New York Times reported that a church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated King. He stated, \"It wasn't a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.\" Wilson provided no evidence to back up his claims.[292]\n",
      "King researchers David Garrow and Gerald Posner disagreed with Pepper's claims that the government killed King.[293] In 2003, Pepper published a book about the investigation and trial, as well as his representation of James Earl Ray in his bid for a trial.[294][295] James Bevel also disputed the argument that Ray acted alone, stating, \"There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man.\"[296] In 2004, Jesse Jackson stated:The fact is there were saboteurs to disrupt the march. And within our own organization, we found a very key person who was on the government payroll. So infiltration within, saboteurs from without and the press attacks. ... I will never believe that James Earl Ray had the motive, the money and the mobility to have done it himself. Our government was very involved in setting the stage for and I think the escape route for James Earl Ray.[297]\n",

King's faith was strongly based in the Golden Rule, loving God above all, and loving your enemies. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to turn the other cheek in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52).[333] In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus' \"extremist\" love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors. In another sermon, he stated:Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry. I don't plan to run for any political office. I don't plan to do anything but remain a preacher.

      "—Martin Luther King Jr.[339]African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin was King's first regular advisor on nonviolence.[340] King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley.[341] Rustin and Smiley came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Mahatma Gandhi's teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s,[342] and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.[341]\n",
      "King initially knew little about Gandhi and rarely used the term \"nonviolence\" during his early activism. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns to defend against possible attackers. The pacifists showing him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.[343][344]\n",
      "In a chapter of Stride Toward Freedom, King outlined his understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat him. The chapter draws from an address by Wofford, with Rustin and Stanley Levison also providing guidance and ghostwriting.[345]\n",
      "King was inspired by Gandhi and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as being one of the \"individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God\".[346] King had \"for a long time ... wanted to take a trip to India.\"[347] With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959.[348][349] The trip deepened his understanding of nonviolent resistance and his commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, \"Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.\"\n",
      "When receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King hailed the \"successful precedent\" of using nonviolence \"in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might of the British Empire ... He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage.\"[350]\n",
      "Another influence for King's nonviolent method was Henry David Thoreau's essay On Civil Disobedience and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system.[351] He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich,[352] and said that Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis left an \"indelible imprint\" on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns.[353][354] King was moved by Rauschenbusch's vision of Christians spreading social unrest in \"perpetual but friendly conflict\" with the state, simultaneously critiquing it and calling it to act as an instrument of justice.[355] However, he was apparently unaware of the American tradition of Christian pacifism exemplified by Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison.[356] King frequently referred to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount as central for his work.[354][357][358][359] Before 1960, King also sometimes used the concept of \"agape\" (brotherly Christian love).[360][361]\n",
      "Even after renouncing personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary.[362] Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson,[363] Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.[364][365]Criticism within the movement\n",
      "King was criticized by other black leaders in the civil rights movement. This included more militant thinkers such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X.[366] Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Ella Baker regarded King as a charismatic media figure who lost touch with the grassroots of the movement[367] as he became close to elite figures like Nelson Rockefeller.[368] Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker's, became a black separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture.[369][370] He also took issue that King's non-violence approach depended on appealing to America's conscience, feeling America had none to appeal to.[371]Activism and involvement with Native Americans\n",
      "King was an avid supporter of Native American rights and Native Americans were active supporters of King's civil rights movement.[372] The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) was patterned after the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund.[373] The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was especially supportive in King's campaigns especially the Poor People's Campaign in 1968.[374] In King's book Why We Can't Wait he writes:Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.[375]\n",
      "In the late 1950, the remaining Creek in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools. Light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride buses to previously all-white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from the same buses.[373] Tribal leaders, hearing of King's desegregation campaign in Birmingham, contacted him for assistance. Through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.[373]\n",
      "In September 1959, after giving a speech at the University of Arizona on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change, King stated his belief that one must not use force in this struggle \"but match the violence of his opponents with his suffering.\"[376] King then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by their photos; he wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Casper Glenn took King to the Papago Indian Reservation.[376] He met with all the tribal leaders, visited another Presbyterian church near the reservation, and preached there, attracting a Native American crowd.[376] He later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where he preached again to a Native American congregation.[376] King would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the 1963 March on Washington there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota and from the Navajo nation.[373][377]\n",
      "King was a major inspiration, along with the civil rights movement, of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s and many of its leaders.[373] John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe who was the executive director and a founder of the Native American Rights Fund, stated:Inspired by Dr. King, who was advancing the civil rights agenda of equality under the laws of this country, we thought that we could also use the laws to advance our Indianship, to live as tribes in our territories governed by our own laws under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with us ever since 1831. We believed that we could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that we could govern our own affairs, define our own ways and continue to survive in this society.[378]\n",
      "Politics\n",
      "As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: \"I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either.\"[379] In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, \"I don't think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses ... And I'm not inextricably bound to either party.\"[380] King did praise Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois as being the \"greatest of all senators\" because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes.[381]\n",
      "King critiqued both parties' performance on promoting racial equality:Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right-wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right-wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.[382]\n",
      "Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he had not decided whether he would vote for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II or Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1956 presidential election, but that \"In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket.\"[383] In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: \"I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one.\" King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying \"Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964.\"[384]\n",
      "In 1964, King urged his supporters \"and all people of goodwill\" to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election \"would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.\"[385] King believed Robert F. Kennedy would make for a good president, but also believed that he wouldn't beat Johnson in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He also expressed support for the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Charles Percy. [386]\n",
      "King rejected both laissez-faire capitalism and communism; King had read Marx while at Morehouse but rejected communism because of its \"materialistic interpretation of history\" that denied religion, its \"ethical relativism\", and its \"political totalitarianism\". He stated that one focused too much on the individual while the other focused too much on the collective.[387] The American philosopher Tommie Shelby has described King as a social democrat who advocated for advocating economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal-democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented mixed economy.[388] However, he was often reluctant to speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of social democratic (\"socialist\") movements with communism. King believed that a laissez-faire economic system would not adequately provide the necessities of many American people, particularly African Americans.[226]\n",
      "In a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, he said: \"I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic ...\"[389][390] In one speech, he stated that \"something is wrong with capitalism\" and said, \"There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\"[391] King further said that \"capitalism has outlived its usefulness\" and \"failed to meet the needs of the masses\".[392]Compensation\n",
      "See also: Reparations for slavery debate in the United States\n",
      "King stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50 billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.[393]\n",
      "He posited that \"the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.\"[394] He presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, \"It should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.\"[395]Television\n",
      "Actress Nichelle Nichols planned to leave the science-fiction television series Star Trek in 1967 after its first season.[396] She changed her mind after talking to King,[397] who was a fan of the show. King explained that her character signified a future of greater racial cooperation.[398] King told Nichols, \"You are our image of where we're going, you're 300 years from now, and that means that's where we are and it takes place now. Keep doing what you're doing, you are our inspiration.\"[399] As Nichols recounted: Star Trek was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow their little children to watch. And I thanked him and I told him I was leaving the show. All the smile came off his face. And he said, 'Don't you understand for the first time we're seen as we should be seen. You don't have a black role. You have an equal role.'[396] The series' creator, Gene Roddenberry, was deeply moved upon learning of King's support.[400]\n",

      "FBI surveillance and wiretapping\n",
      "Memo describing FBI attempts to disrupt the Poor People's Campaign with fraudulent claims about King‍—‌part of the COINTELPRO campaign against the anti-war and civil rights movements\n",
      "FBI director J. Edgar Hoover personally ordered surveillance of King, with the intent to undermine his power as a civil rights leader.[401][402] The Church Committee, a 1975 investigation by the U.S. Congress, found that \"From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'neutralize' him as an effective civil rights leader.\"[403]\n",
      "In the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to proceed with wiretapping of King's phone lines, purportedly due to his association with Stanley Levison.[404] The Bureau informed President John F. Kennedy. He and his brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from Levison, a New York lawyer who had been involved with Communist Party USA.[405][406] Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's telephone lines \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\",[407] Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.[114]\n",
      "The Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Levison and King, and bugged King's rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country.[405][408] In 1967, Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: \"No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups ... to insure  [sic] the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited.\"[402][409]NSA monitoring of King's communications\n",
      "In a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who were critical of the U.S. war in Vietnam.[410] A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was \"disreputable if not outright illegal\".[410]Allegations of communism\n",
      "For years, Hoover had been suspicious of potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights.[411] Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC when it was established.[3]\n",
      "Due to the relationship between King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Levison was working as an \"agent of influence\" over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them.[412] Another King lieutenant, Jack O'Dell, was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).[413]\n",
      "Despite the extensive surveillance, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.[403]\n",
      "For his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 Playboy interview, he stated that \"there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.\"[414] He argued that Hoover was \"following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South\" and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to \"aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements.\"[403] Hoover replied by saying that King was \"the most notorious liar in the country\".[415] After his \"I Have A Dream\" speech, the FBI described King as \"the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country\".[408] It alleged that he was \"knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists.\"[416]\n",
      "The attempts to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo but had been stirred up by \"communists\" and \"outside agitators\".[417] King said that \"the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals—the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations.\"[418]CIA surveillance\n",
      "CIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation.[419] Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program HTLINGUAL.[420]Allegations of adultery\n",
      "The only meeting of King and Malcolm X, outside the United States Senate chamber, March 26, 1964, during the Senate debates regarding the (eventual) Civil Rights Act of 1964[421]\n",
      "The FBI attempted to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he had numerous extramarital affairs.[408] The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King's family.[422] The bureau also sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information if he did not cease his civil rights work.[423] The FBI–King suicide letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part:The FBI–King suicide letter,[424] mailed anonymously by the FBI\n",
      "The American public, the church organizations that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant  [sic]). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.[425]\n",
      "The letter was accompanied by a tape recording—excerpted from FBI wiretaps—of several of King's extramarital liaisons.[426] King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide,[427] although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to \"convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC.\"[403] King refused to succumb to the FBI's threats.[408]\n",
      "In 1977, Judge John Lewis Smith Jr. ordered the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI's electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to sealed from public access in the National Archives until 2027.[428]In May 2019, an FBI file emerged on which a handwritten note alleged that King \"looked on, laughed and offered advice\" as one of his friends raped a woman. Historians of the period who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed it as highly unreliable.[429][430] David Garrow, author of an earlier biography of King, wrote that \"the suggestion ... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible\".[431][430] Garrow's reliance on a handwritten note addended to a typed report is considered poor scholarship by several other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that Garrow was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of FBI reports during a period when the FBI was undertaking a massive operation to attempt to discredit King.[432] Experts in 20th-century American history, including Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis, the professors Barbara Ransby of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Nathan Connolly of Johns Hopkins University and Professor Emeritus of History Glenda Gilmore of Yale University have expressed reservations about Garrow's scholarship. Theoharis commented \"Most scholars I know would penalize graduate students for doing this.\" It is not the first time the care and rigor of Garrow's work has been called into serious question.[430] Clayborne Carson, Martin Luther King biographer and overseer of the Dr. King records at Stanford University states that he came to the opposite conclusion of Garrow: None of this is new. Garrow is talking about a recently added summary of a transcript of a 1964 recording from the Willard Hotel that others, including Mrs. King, have said they did not hear Martin's voice on it. The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report. You have to ask how could anyone conclude King looked at a rape from an audio recording in a room where he was not present.[433] The tapes that could confirm or refute the allegation are scheduled to be declassified in 2027.[434]\n",
      "In his 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down, Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a \"weakness for women\", although they \"all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.\"[435] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term \"womanizing\", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual.[436] Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs,[436] such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.[436]\n",
      "In his 1986 book Bearing the Cross, David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, \"that relationship ... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King's life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings ... of King's travels.\" He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as \"a form of anxiety reduction\". Garrow asserted that King's supposed promiscuity caused him \"painful and at times overwhelming guilt\".[437] King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that \"all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.\"[438] Shortly after Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow's allegations about King's sex life were \"sensational\" and stated that Garrow was \"amassing facts rather than analyzing them\".[439]Police observation during the assassination\n",
      "A fire station was located across from the Lorraine Motel, next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying. Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance.[440] Agents were watching King at the time he was shot.[441] Immediately following the shooting, officers rushed to the motel. Marrell McCollough, an undercover police officer, was the first person to administer first aid to King.[442] The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.[443]Awards and recognition\n",

      "King was awarded at least fifty honorary degrees from colleges and universities.[444] On October 14, 1964, King became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to him for leading nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in the U.S.[445][446] In 1965, he was awarded the American Liberties Medallion by the American Jewish Committee for his \"exceptional advancement of the principles of human liberty.\"[444][447] In his acceptance remarks, King said, \"Freedom is one thing.

That is the problem of racism, the problem of poverty and the problem of war.\n",

      "^ King Jr's birth certificate was later altered to read \"Martin Luther King Jr.\" on July 23, 1957, when he was 28 years old.[21][22][24]^ There is some disagreement in sources regarding precisely when King took and passed the entrance exam in 1944. Oates (1993) and Schuman (2014) state that King passed the exam in the spring of 1944 before graduating from the eleventh grade and then being enrolled in Morehouse that fall. Manheimer (2005) states that King graduated from the eleventh grade, then applied and took the entrance exam before going to Connecticut, but did not find out he had passed until August 1944 when he was admitted. White (1974) states he took and passed the exam upon his return from Connecticut in 1944.^ Though commonly attributed to King, this expression originated with 19th-century abolitionist Theodore Parker.[189]\n",

      "Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Christian minister, activist, and political philosopher who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and other forms of legalized discrimination. \n",
      "\n",
      "----------\n",
      "King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights.[1] He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the 1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n",
      "\n",
      "----------\n",
      "The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently.[2] King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.[3]\n",

      "On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance.  In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was convicted of the assassination, though the King family believes he was a scapegoat; the assassination remains the subject of conspiracy theories. King's death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n",

      "King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams).[4][5][6] King had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel \"A. D.\" King.[7] Alberta's father, Adam Daniel Williams,[8] was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893,[6] and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year.[9] Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks.[6] King Sr. was born to sharecroppers James Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia,[5][6] and was of African-Irish descent.[10][11][12] As an adolescent, King Sr. left his parents' farm and walked to Atlanta, where he attained a high school education,[13][14][15] and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry.[15] King Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926.[16][17] Until Jennie's death in 1941, they lived together on the second floor of Alberta's parents' Victorian house, where King was born.[18][16][17][19]\n",
      "\n",
      "----------\n",
      "Shortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church.[17] Senior pastor Williams died in the spring of 1931[17] and, that fall, King Sr. took the role. With support from his wife, he would raise attendance from six hundred to several thousand.[6][17][20] In 1934, the church sent King Sr. on a multinational trip, including to Berlin for the Congress of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA).[21] He also visited sites in Germany that were associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther.[21] In reaction to the rise of Nazism, the BWA issued a resolution stating, \"This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world.\"[22] On returning home in August 1934, King Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son's name to Martin Luther King Jr.[21][23][16][a]\n",
      "\n",
      "----------\n",
      "At his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father.[25] After dinners, King's grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as \"Mama\", would tell lively stories from the Bible.[25] King's father would regularly use whippings to discipline his children,[26] sometimes having them whip each other.[26] King's father later remarked, \"[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He'd stand there, and the tears would run down, and he'd never cry.\"[27] Once, when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it.[26][28] When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive.[29][28] King, believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window,[30][28] but rose from the ground on hearing that she was alive.[30]\n",
      "\n",

      "King became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his home.[31] In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school.[31][32] King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School,[31][33] while his playmate went to a separate school for white children only.[31][33] Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, \"we are white, and you are colored\".[31][34] When King relayed this to his parents, they discussed with him the history of slavery and racism in America,[31][35] which King would later state made him \"determined to hate every white person\".[31] His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "----------\n",
      "King witnessed his father stand up against segregation and discrimination.[36] Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as \"boy\", King's father responded sharply that King Jr. was a boy but he was a man.[36] When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back.[37] King's father refused, stating \"we'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all\", before leaving the store with King.[14] He told King afterward, \"I don't care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.\"[14] In 1936, King's father led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination.[26] King later remarked that King Sr. was \"a real father\" to him.[38]\n",
      "\n",

      "King memorized hymns and Bible verses by the time he was five years old.[30] Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing hymns while she played piano.[30] His favorite hymn was \"I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus\"; he moved attendees with his singing.[30] King later became a member of the junior choir in his church.[39] King enjoyed opera, and played the piano.[40] King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries.[28] He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stymie fights.[28][40] King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait that persisted throughout his life.[40] In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir in slave costume, for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film Gone with the Wind.[41][42] In September 1940, at the age of 11, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the seventh grade.[43][44] While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and showed keen interest in history and English classes.[43]\n",

      "On May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother.[38] Upon returning home, he learned she had a heart attack and died while being transported to a hospital.[19] He took the death very hard and believed that his deception of going to see the parade may have been responsible for God taking her.[19] King jumped out of a second-story window at his home, but again survived.[19][27][28] His father instructed him that King should not blame himself, and that she had been called home to God as part of God's plan.[19][45] King struggled with this.[19] Shortly thereafter, King's father decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "----------\n",
      "As an adolescent, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the \"racial humiliation\" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure.[46] In 1942, when King was 13, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal.[47] That year, King skipped the ninth grade and was enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School, where he maintained a B-plus average.[45][48] The high school was the only one in the city for African-American students.[17]\n",

King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King's father,[85] advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later.

The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King,[108] as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker.[109] King led the SCLC until his death.[110] The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.[111]\n",

Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit's expenses and assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. King served as honorary president of this organization, named the \"Gandhi Society for Human Rights\". In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on President Kennedy to issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order.[112] The FBI, under written directive from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, began tapping King's telephone line in the fall of 1963.[113] Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.[114] FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration.

King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano.[120] King underwent emergency surgery by Aubre de Lambert Maynard, Emil Naclerio and John W. V.

Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver expressed open hostility towards King's return. He claimed that \"wherever M. L. King Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes\", and vowed to keep King under surveillance.[124] On May 4, 1960, King drove writer Lillian Smith to Emory University when police stopped them. King was cited for \"driving without a license\" because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license.

The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside Rich's, Atlanta's largest department store, and was among the many arrested that day. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except for King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor.

Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship before, declined to make a statement despite a personal visit from Jackie Robinson requesting his intervention. Nixon's opponent John F. Kennedy called the governor (a Democrat) directly, enlisted his brother Robert to exert more pressure on state authorities, and, at the personal request of Sargent Shriver, called King's wife to offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later.

However, the negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city's lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools.[129][130] Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a large meeting on March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated.

When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he \"had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel.\"[132] The following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions.

King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a \"Day of Penance\" to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts.[135] Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement,[136] the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC.

In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm's way.

The letter has been described as \"one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner\".[146] King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: \"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\"[147] He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, \"everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal'.\"[147] Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged for $160,000 to bail out King and his fellow protestors.[148]\n",

However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed.[156] With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to ensure its success.

The group acquiesced to presidential pressure, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.[158] As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the \"Farce on Washington\", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending.[158][159]\n",

However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them.[170][171] King and the SCLC worked to bring white Northern activists to St. Augustine, including a delegation of rabbis and the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, all of whom were arrested.[172][173] During June, the movement marched nightly through the city, \"often facing counter demonstrations by the Klan, and provoking violence that garnered national media attention.\" Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed. During this movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.[174]\n",

This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965.[183] During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.\n",

The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel's nonviolence strategy.[52]\n",

The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement.[186] The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.[187][188] At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as \"How Long, Not Long\". King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, \"because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\" and \"you shall reap what you sow\".[c][189][190][191]\n",

      "The letter was accompanied by a tape recording—excerpted from FBI wiretaps—of several of King's extramarital liaisons.[426] King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide,[427] although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to \"convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC.\"[403] King refused to succumb to the FBI's threats.[408]\n",

      "In May 2019, an FBI file emerged on which a handwritten note alleged that King \"looked on, laughed and offered advice\" as one of his friends raped a woman. Historians of the period who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed it as highly unreliable.[429][430] David Garrow, author of an earlier biography of King, wrote that \"the suggestion ... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible\".[431][430] Garrow's reliance on a handwritten note addended to a typed report is considered poor scholarship by several other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that Garrow was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of FBI reports during a period when the FBI was undertaking a massive operation to attempt to discredit King.[432] Experts in 20th-century American history, including Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis, the professors Barbara Ransby of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Nathan Connolly of Johns Hopkins University and Professor Emeritus of History Glenda Gilmore of Yale University have expressed reservations about Garrow's scholarship. Theoharis commented \"Most scholars I know would penalize graduate students for doing this.\" It is not the first time the care and rigor of Garrow's work has been called into serious question.[430] Clayborne Carson, Martin Luther King biographer and overseer of the Dr. King records at Stanford University states that he came to the opposite conclusion of Garrow: \n",
      "----------\n",
      "None of this is new. Garrow is talking about a recently added summary of a transcript of a 1964 recording from the Willard Hotel that others, including Mrs. King, have said they did not hear Martin's voice on it. The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report. You have to ask how could anyone conclude King looked at a rape from an audio recording in a room where he was not present.[433]\n",

      "In his 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down, Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a \"weakness for women\", although they \"all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.\"[435] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term \"womanizing\", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual.[436] Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs,[436] such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.[436]\n",
      "In his 1986 book Bearing the Cross, David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, \"that relationship ... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King's life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings ... of King's travels.\" He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as \"a form of anxiety reduction\". Garrow asserted that King's supposed promiscuity caused him \"painful and at times overwhelming guilt\".[437] King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that \"all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.\"[438] Shortly after Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow's allegations about King's sex life were \"sensational\" and stated that Garrow was \"amassing facts rather than analyzing them\".[439]\n",

Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance.[440] Agents were watching King at the time he was shot.[441] Immediately following the shooting, officers rushed to the motel. Marrell McCollough, an undercover police officer, was the first person to administer first aid to King.[442] The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.[443]\n",

      "Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Christian minister, activist, and political philosopher who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and other forms of legalized discrimination. \n",
      "\n",
      "King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights.[1] He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the 1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently.[2] King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance.  In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was convicted of the assassination, though the King family believes he was a scapegoat; the assassination remains the subject of conspiracy theories. King's death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams).[4][5][6] King had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel \"A. D.\" King.[7] Alberta's father, Adam Daniel Williams,[8] was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893,[6] and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year.[9] Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks.[6] King Sr. was born to sharecroppers James Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia,[5][6] and was of African-Irish descent.[10][11][12] As an adolescent, King Sr. left his parents' farm and walked to Atlanta, where he attained a high school education,[13][14][15] and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry.[15] King Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926.[16][17] Until Jennie's death in 1941, they lived together on the second floor of Alberta's parents' Victorian house, where King was born.[18][16][17][19]\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church.[17] Senior pastor Williams died in the spring of 1931[17] and, that fall, King Sr. took the role. With support from his wife, he would raise attendance from six hundred to several thousand.[6][17][20] In 1934, the church sent King Sr. on a multinational trip, including to Berlin for the Congress of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA).[21] He also visited sites in Germany that were associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther.[21] In reaction to the rise of Nazism, the BWA issued a resolution stating, \"This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world.\"[22] On returning home in August 1934, King Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son's name to Martin Luther King Jr.[21][23][16][a]\n",
      "\n",
      "At his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father.[25] After dinners, King's grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as \"Mama\", would tell lively stories from the Bible.[25] King's father would regularly use whippings to discipline his children,[26] sometimes having them whip each other.[26] King's father later remarked, \"[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He'd stand there, and the tears would run down, and he'd never cry.\"[27] Once, when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it.[26][28] When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive.[29][28] King, believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window,[30][28] but rose from the ground on hearing that she was alive.[30]\n",
      "\n",
      "King became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his home.[31] In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school.[31][32] King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School,[31][33] while his playmate went to a separate school for white children only.[31][33] Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, \"we are white, and you are colored\".[31][34] When King relayed this to his parents, they discussed with him the history of slavery and racism in America,[31][35] which King would later state made him \"determined to hate every white person\".[31] His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "King witnessed his father stand up against segregation and discrimination.[36] Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as \"boy\", King's father responded sharply that King Jr. was a boy but he was a man.[36] When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back.[37] King's father refused, stating \"we'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all\", before leaving the store with King.[14] He told King afterward, \"I don't care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.\"[14] In 1936, King's father led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination.[26] King later remarked that King Sr. was \"a real father\" to him.[38]\n",
      "\n",
      "King memorized hymns and Bible verses by the time he was five years old.[30] Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing hymns while she played piano.[30] His favorite hymn was \"I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus\"; he moved attendees with his singing.[30] King later became a member of the junior choir in his church.[39] King enjoyed opera, and played the piano.[40] King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries.[28] He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stymie fights.[28][40] King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait that persisted throughout his life.[40] In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir in slave costume, for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film Gone with the Wind.[41][42] In September 1940, at the age of 11, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the seventh grade.[43][44] While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and showed keen interest in history and English classes.[43]\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother.[38] Upon returning home, he learned she had a heart attack and died while being transported to a hospital.[19] He took the death very hard and believed that his deception of going to see the parade may have been responsible for God taking her.[19] King jumped out of a second-story window at his home, but again survived.[19][27][28] His father instructed him that King should not blame himself, and that she had been called home to God as part of God's plan.[19][45] King struggled with this.[19] Shortly thereafter, King's father decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "As an adolescent, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the \"racial humiliation\" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure.[46] In 1942, when King was 13, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal.[47] That year, King skipped the ninth grade and was enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School, where he maintained a B-plus average.[45][48] The high school was the only one in the city for African-American students.[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "While King was brought up in a Baptist home, as he entered adolescence he began to question the literalist teachings preached at his father's church.[45][49] At the age of 13, he denied the bodily resurrection of Jesus during Sunday school.[50][49] King said that he found himself unable to identify with the emotional displays from congregants frequent at his church, and doubted if he would ever attain personal satisfaction from religion.[51][49] He later stated of this point in his life, \"doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly.\"[52][50][49]\n",
      "\n",
      "In high school, King became known for his public-speaking ability, with a voice that had grown into an orotund baritone.[53][48] He joined the school's debate team.[53][48] King continued to be most drawn to history and English,[48] and chose English and sociology as his main subjects.[54] King maintained an abundant vocabulary.[48] However, he relied on his sister Christine to help him with spelling, while King assisted her with math.[48] King also developed an interest in fashion, commonly wearing polished patent leather shoes and tweed suits, which gained him the nickname \"Tweed\" or \"Tweedie\" among his friends.[55][56][57][58] He liked flirting with girls and dancing.[57][56][59] His brother A.D. later remarked, \"He kept flitting from chick to chick, and I decided I couldn't keep up with him. Especially since he was crazy about dances, and just about the best jitterbug in town.\"[56]\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 13, 1944, in his junior year, King gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest.[60][56][61][62] In his speech he stated, \"black America still wears chains. The finest negro is at the mercy of the meanest white man.\"[63][60] King was selected as the winner of the contest.[60][56] On the ride home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit.[56][64] The driver of the bus called King a \"black son-of-a-bitch\".[56] King initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not.[64] As all the seats were occupied, he and his teacher were forced to stand the rest of the way to Atlanta.[56] Later King wrote of the incident: \"That night will never leave my memory. It was the angriest I have ever been in my life.\"[64]\n",
      "\n",
      "During King's junior year in high school, Morehouse College—an all-male historically black college that King's father and maternal grandfather had attended[65][66]—began accepting high school juniors who passed the entrance examination.[56][67][64] As World War II was underway many black college students had been enlisted,[56][67] so the university aimed to increase their enrolment by allowing juniors to apply.[56][67][64] In 1944, aged 15, King passed the examination and was enrolled at the university that autumn.[b][56][67][65][68]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer before King started at Morehouse, he boarded a train with his friend—Emmett \"Weasel\" Proctor—and a group of other Morehouse College students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut, at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco.[69][70] This was King's first trip into the integrated north.[71][72] In a June 1944 letter to his father King wrote about the differences that struck him: \"On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see. After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit anywhere we want to.\"[71] The farm had partnered with Morehouse College to allot their salaries towards the university's tuition, housing, and fees.[69][70] On weekdays King and the other students worked in the fields, picking tobacco from 7:00am to at least 5:00pm, enduring temperatures above 100 °F, to earn roughly USD$4 per day.[70][71] On Friday evenings, the students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to Hartford, Connecticut, to see theatre performances, shop and eat in restaurants.[70][72] On Sundays they attended church services in Hartford, at a church filled with white congregants.[70] King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation, relaying how he was amazed they could go to \"one of the finest restaurants in Hartford\" and that \"Negroes and whites go to the same church\".[70][73][71]\n",
      "\n",
      "He played freshman football there. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He would later credit the college's president, Baptist minister Benjamin Mays, with being his \"spiritual mentor\".[74] King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer \"an inner urge to serve humanity\", and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a \"rational\" minister with sermons that were \"a respectful force for ideas, even social protest.\"[75] King graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 1948, aged nineteen.[76]\n",
      "\n",
      "King enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania,[77][78] and took several courses at the University of Pennsylvania.[79][80] At Crozer, King was elected president of the student body.[81] At Penn, King took courses with William Fontaine, Penn's first African-American professor, and Elizabeth F. Flower, a professor of philosophy.[82] King's father supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with J. Pius Barbour, a family friend and Crozer alumnus who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania.[83] King became known as one of the \"Sons of Calvary\", an honor he shared with William Augustus Jones Jr. and Samuel D. Proctor, who both went on to become well-known preachers.[84]\n",
      "\n",
      "King once reproved another student for keeping beer in his room, saying they shared responsibility as African Americans to bear \"the burdens of the Negro race\". For a time, he was interested in Walter Rauschenbusch's \"social gospel\".[81] In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with[85] the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked in the cafeteria. King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King's father,[85] advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. One friend was quoted as saying, \"He never recovered.\"[81] Other friends, including Harry Belafonte, said Betty had been \"the love of King's life.\"[85] King graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity in 1951.[77] He applied to the University of Edinburgh for a doctorate in the School of Divinity but ultimately chose Boston instead.[86]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1951, King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University,[87] and worked as an assistant minister at Boston's historic Twelfth Baptist Church with William Hunter Hester. Hester was an old friend of King's father and was an important influence on King.[88] In Boston, King befriended a small cadre of local ministers his age, and sometimes guest pastored at their churches, including Michael Haynes, associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. The young men often held bull sessions in their apartments, discussing theology, sermon style, and social issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the age of 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.[89] King received his PhD on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation (initially supervised by Edgar S. Brightman and, upon the latter's death, by Lotan Harold DeWolf) titled A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.[90][87]\n",

However, \"[d]espite its finding, the committee said that 'no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King's doctoral degree,' an action that the panel said would serve no purpose.\"[91][87][92] The committee found that the dissertation still \"makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship.\" A letter is now attached to the copy of King's dissertation in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources.[93] Significant debate exists on how to interpret King's plagiarism.[94]\n",

      "While studying at Boston University, he asked a friend from Atlanta named Mary Powell, a student at the New England Conservatory of Music, if she knew any nice Southern girls. Powell spoke to fellow student Coretta Scott; Scott was not interested in dating preachers but eventually agreed to allow King to telephone her based on Powell's description and vouching. On their first call, King told Scott, \"I am like Napoleon at Waterloo before your charms,\" to which she replied, \"You haven't even met me.\" King married Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house, in Heiberger, Alabama.[95] They had four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b. 1957), Dexter Scott King (1961–2024), and Bernice King (b. 1963).[96] King limited Coretta's role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.[97]\n",

      "In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation.[99] Nine months later on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus.[100] The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Edgar Nixon and led by King.[101] The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant but decided to do so if no one else wanted it.[102]\n",

      "The boycott lasted for 385 days,[103] and the situation became so tense that King's house was bombed.[104] King was arrested for traveling 30 mph in a 25 mph zone[105] and jailed, which overnight drew the attention of national media, and greatly increased King's public stature. The controversy ended when the United States District Court issued a ruling in Browder v. Gayle that prohibited racial segregation on Montgomery public buses.[106][1][102]\n",

      "In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King,[108] as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker.[109] King led the SCLC until his death.[110] The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.[111]\n",

      "Harry Wachtel joined King's legal advisor Clarence B. Jones in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case Abernathy et al. v. Sullivan; the case was litigated about the newspaper advertisement \"Heed Their Rising Voices\". Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit's expenses and assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. King served as honorary president of this organization, named the \"Gandhi Society for Human Rights\". In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on President Kennedy to issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order.[112] The FBI, under written directive from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, began tapping King's telephone line in the fall of 1963.[113] Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders.[114] FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years, as part of its COINTELPRO program, in attempts to force King out of his leadership position.[3]\n",

      "King believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights supporters, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.[115][116]\n",

      "King organized and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights.[1] Most of these rights were successfully enacted into law with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.[117][118]\n",

      "On September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book Stride Toward Freedom in Blumstein's department store in Harlem[119] when Izola Curry—a mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communists—stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, which nearly impinged on the aorta. King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano.[120] King underwent emergency surgery by Aubre de Lambert Maynard, Emil Naclerio and John W. V. Cordice; he remained hospitalized for several weeks. Curry was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial.[121][122]\n",

      "In December 1959, after being based in Montgomery for five years, King announced his return to Atlanta at the request of the SCLC.[123] In Atlanta, King served until his death as co-pastor with his father at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver expressed open hostility towards King's return. He claimed that \"wherever M. L. King Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes\", and vowed to keep King under surveillance.[124] On May 4, 1960, King drove writer Lillian Smith to Emory University when police stopped them. King was cited for \"driving without a license\" because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license. King's Alabama license was still valid, and Georgia law did not mandate any time limit for issuing a local license.[125] King paid a fine but was unaware that his lawyer agreed to a plea deal that included probation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Atlanta Student Movement had been acting to desegregate businesses and public spaces, organizing the Atlanta sit-ins from March 1960 onwards. In August the movement asked King to participate in a mass October sit-in, timed to highlight how 1960's Presidential election campaign had ignored civil rights. The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside Rich's, Atlanta's largest department store, and was among the many arrested that day. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except for King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor. Before dawn the next day, King was transported to Georgia State Prison.[126]\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrest and harsh sentence drew nationwide attention. Many feared for King's safety, as he started a prison sentence with people convicted of violent crimes, many of them White and hostile to his activism.[127] Both Presidential candidates were asked to weigh in, at a time when both parties were courting the support of Southern Whites and their political leadership including Governor Vandiver. Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship before, declined to make a statement despite a personal visit from Jackie Robinson requesting his intervention. Nixon's opponent John F. Kennedy called the governor (a Democrat) directly, enlisted his brother Robert to exert more pressure on state authorities, and, at the personal request of Sargent Shriver, called King's wife to offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later. King's father decided to openly endorse Kennedy's candidacy for the November 8 election which he narrowly won.[128]\n",

      "After the October 19 sit-ins and following unrest, a 30-day truce was declared in Atlanta for desegregation negotiations. However, the negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city's lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools.[129][130] Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a large meeting on March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated. King then gave an impassioned speech calling participants to resist the \"cancerous disease of disunity\", helping to calm tensions.[131]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany, Georgia, in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation in the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he \"had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel.\"[132] The following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, \"that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city\" after he left.[132]\n",
      "\n",
      "King returned in July 1962 and was given the option of forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine (equivalent to $1,700 in 2022); he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. \"We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools ... ejected from churches ... and thrown into jail ... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail.\"[133] It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out.[134]\n",
      "\n",
      "After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a \"Day of Penance\" to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts.[135] Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement,[136] the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.[137]\n",

      "In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Wyatt Tee Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "King's intent was to provoke mass arrests and \"create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.\"[139] The campaign's early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police's actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist James Bevel changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join the demonstrations.[140] Newsweek called this strategy a Children's Crusade.[141][142]\n",

      "The Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement.[143] Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm's way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the \"Jim Crow\" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King's reputation improved immensely.[141]\n",

      "King was arrested and jailed early in the campaign—his 13th arrest[144] out of 29.[145] From his cell, he composed the now-famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" that responds to calls to pursue legal channels for social change. The letter has been described as \"one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner\".[146] King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: \"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\"[147] He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, \"everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal'.\"[147] Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged for $160,000 to bail out King and his fellow protestors.[148]\n",

      "King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the \"Big Six\" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were Roy Wilkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young, National Urban League; A.

      "Bayard Rustin's open homosexuality, support of socialism, and former ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin,[150] which King agreed to do.[151] However, he did collaborate in the 1963 March on Washington, for which Rustin was the primary organizer.[152][153] For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of President Kennedy in changing the focus of the march.[154][155] Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed.[156] With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000 and enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators.[157]\n",

      "The march originally was planned to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.[158] As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the \"Farce on Washington\", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending.[158][159]\n",
      "\n",
      "The march made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers (equivalent to $19 in 2022); and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee.[160][161][162] Despite tensions, the march was a resounding success.[163] More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.[163]\n",

      "\"I Have a Dream\" came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory.[167] The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[168][169]\n",

      "In March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling's then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida. Hayling's group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was forced out of the organization for advocating armed self-defense alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them.[170][171] King and the SCLC worked to bring white Northern activists to St. Augustine, including a delegation of rabbis and the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, all of whom were arrested.[172][173] During June, the movement marched nightly through the city, \"often facing counter demonstrations by the Klan, and provoking violence that garnered national media attention.\" Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed. During this movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.[174]\n",

      "On February 6, 1964, King delivered the inaugural speech[178] of a lecture series initiated at the New School called \"The American Race Crisis\". In his remarks, King referred to a conversation he had recently had with Jawaharlal Nehru in which he compared the sad condition of many African Americans to that of India's untouchables.[179] In his March 18, 1964, interview with Robert Penn Warren, King compared his activism to his father's, citing his training in non-violence as a key difference. He also discusses the next phase of the civil rights movement and integration.[180]\n",

      "Starting in November 1964, King supported a labor strike by several hundred workers at the Scripto factory in Atlanta, just a few blocks from Ebenezer Baptist.[181] Many of the strikers were congregants of his church, and the strike was supported by other civil rights leaders.[181] King helped elevate the labor dispute from a local to nationally known event and led the SCLC to organize a nationwide boycott of Scripto products.[181] However, as the strike stretched into December, King, who was wanting to focus more on a civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, began to negotiate in secret with Scripto's president Carl Singer and eventually brokered a deal where the SCLC would call off their boycott in exchange for the company giving the striking employees their Christmas bonuses.[181] King's involvement in the strike ended on December 24 and a contract between the company and union was signed on January 9.[181]\n",

      "In December 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Selma, Alabama, where the SNCC had been working on voter registration for several months.[182] A local judge issued an injunction that barred any gathering of three or more people affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named civil rights leaders. This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965.[183] During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acting on James Bevel's call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Bevel and other SCLC members, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel's nonviolence strategy.[52]\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 5, King met with officials in the Johnson Administration to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, \"If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.\"[184] Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.[185]\n",
      "\n",
      "King next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement.[186] The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965.[187][188] At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as \"How Long, Not Long\". King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, \"because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\" and \"you shall reap what you sow\".[c][189][190][191]\n",

      "In 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S.

      "King later stated and Abernathy wrote that the movement received a worse reception in Chicago than in the South. Marches, especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5, 1966, were met by thrown bottles and screaming throngs. Rioting seemed very possible.[198][199] King's beliefs militated against his staging a violent event, and he negotiated an agreement with Mayor Richard J. Daley to cancel a march in order to avoid the violence that he feared would result.[200] King was hit by a brick during one march, but continued to lead marches in the face of personal danger.[201]\n",

He summed up this aspect by saying, \"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\"[212] He stated that North Vietnam \"did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands\",[213] and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, \"mostly children\".[214] King also criticized American opposition to North Vietnam's land reforms.[215]\n",

      "King's opposition cost him significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, Billy Graham, union leaders and powerful publishers.[216][217][218] \"The press is being stacked against me\", King said,[219] complaining of what he described as a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied \"toward little brown Vietnamese children\".[220] Life magazine called the speech \"demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi\",[212] and The Washington Post declared that King had \"diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.\"[220][221]\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech reflected King's evolving political advocacy in his later years, which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center, with which he was affiliated.[222][223] King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the American political and economic situation, and more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct injustice.[224][225] He guarded his language in public to avoid being linked to communism, but in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism.[226][227]\n",
      "\n",
      "King stated in \"Beyond Vietnam\" that \"true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\"[228] King quoted a U.S. official who said that from Vietnam to Latin America, the country was \"on the wrong side of a world revolution.\"[228] King condemned America's \"alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America\", and said that the U.S. should support \"the shirtless and barefoot people\" in the Third World rather than suppressing their attempts at revolution.[228]\n",

      "King's stance on Vietnam encouraged Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, with the support of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal as he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited to activism.[229]\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 15, 1967, King spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan's Central Park to the United Nations. The march was organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam under chairman James Bevel. At the U.N. King brought up issues of civil rights and the draft:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements. There are people who have come to see the moral imperative of equality, but who cannot yet see the moral imperative of world brotherhood. I would like to see the fervor of the civil-rights movement imbued into the peace movement to instill it with greater strength. And I believe everyone has a duty to be in both the civil-rights and peace movements. But for those who presently choose but one, I would hope they will finally come to see the moral roots common to both.[230]\n",
      "Seeing an opportunity to unite civil rights and anti-war activists,[208] Bevel convinced King to become even more active in the anti-war effort.[208] Despite his growing public opposition to the Vietnam War, King was not fond of the hippie culture which developed from the anti-war movement.[231] In his 1967 Massey Lecture, King stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance of the hippies is not in their unconventional behavior, but in the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people, in turning to a flight from reality, are expressing a profoundly discrediting view on the society they emerge from.[231]\n",
      "On January 13, 1968, King called for a large march on Washington against \"one of history's most cruel and senseless wars\":[232][233]\n",

      "We need to make clear in this political year, to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the United States, that we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killings of Vietnamese and Americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self-determination in Southeast Asia.[232][233]\n",
      "Thích Nhất Hạnh was an influential Vietnamese Buddhist who wrote a letter to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965 entitled: \"In Search of the Enemy of Man\". It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War.[234] In 1967, King gave a famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam.[235] Later that year, King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, \"I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity\".[236]\n",

      "In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the \"Poor People's Campaign\" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \"economic bill of rights\".[237][238]\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign was preceded by King's final book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from Henry George's book Progress and Poverty, particularly in support of a guaranteed basic income.[239][240][241] The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "King and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America's cities. He felt that Congress had shown \"hostility to the poor\" by spending \"military funds with alacrity and generosity\". He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided \"poverty funds with miserliness\".[238] His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of \"racism, poverty, militarism and materialism\", and argued that \"reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced.\"[242]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Poor People's Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate repression on the poor and the black.[243]\n",

      "On March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of the black sanitation workers, who were represented by AFSCME Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.[247][248][249]\n",

      "On April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" address at Mason Temple. King's flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane.[250] In reference to the bomb threat, King said:\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?\n",
      "Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.[251]\n",
      "King was booked in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Ralph Abernathy, who was present at the assassination, testified to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations that King and his entourage stayed at Room 306 so often that it was known as the \"King-Abernathy suite\".[252] According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King's last words were spoken to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: \"Ben, make sure you play 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\"[253]\n",

Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign rally when he was informed of King's death. He gave a short, improvised speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King's ideal of nonviolence.[263] The following day, he delivered a prepared response in Cleveland.[264] James Farmer Jr. and other civil rights leaders also called for non-violent action, while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more forceful response.[265] The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.[266]\n",

      "The plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King's plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations to carry it out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered.[267] Thousands of demonstrators arrived on the National Mall and stayed for six weeks, establishing a camp they called \"Resurrection City\".[268]\n",

      "President Johnson tried to quell the riots by making telephone calls to civil rights leaders, mayors and governors across the United States and told politicians that they should warn the police against the unwarranted use of force.[262] However, \"I'm not getting through,\" Johnson told his aides. \"They're all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.\"[262] Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for King.[269]\n",
      "Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended King's funeral on behalf of the President, as there were fears that Johnson's presence might incite protests and perhaps violence.[270] At his widow's request, King's last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, given on February 4, 1968, was played at the funeral:[271]\n",

      "Two months after King's death, James Earl Ray—on the loose from a previous prison escape—was captured at London Heathrow Airport while trying to reach white-ruled Rhodesia on a false Canadian passport. He was using the alias Ramon George Sneyd.[274] Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder. He confessed on March 10, 1969, though he recanted this confession three days later.[275] On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray pleaded guilty to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term.[275][276] Ray later claimed a man he met in Montreal, Quebec, with the alias \"Raoul\" was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy.[277][278] He spent the remainder of his life attempting, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had.[276] Ray died in 1998 at age 70.[279]\n",

      "Ray's lawyers maintained he was a scapegoat similar to the way that John F. Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is seen by conspiracy theorists.[280] Supporters of this assertion said that Ray's confession was given under pressure and that he had been threatened with the death penalty.[276][281] They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon.[278] However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for armed robbery.[282] In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. \"I never been with nobody as bold as he is,\" Jerry said. \"He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it's an everyday thing.\"[282]\n",
      "\n",
      "Those suspecting a conspiracy point to the two successive ballistics tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray's Remington Gamemaster had been the murder weapon. Those tests did not implicate Ray's specific rifle.[276][283] Witnesses near King said that the shot came from another location, from behind thick shrubbery near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window.[284] However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from.[282] An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm at the time of the assassination.[282]\n",

Pepper,[286] won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and \"other unknown co-conspirators\". Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King's assassination.

This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination.[313] The day following King's assassination, teacher Jane Elliott conducted her first \"Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes\" exercise with her class of elementary school students to help them understand King's death as it related to racism.[314]\n",

King's faith was strongly based in the Golden Rule, loving God above all, and loving your enemies. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to turn the other cheek in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52).[333] In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus' \"extremist\" love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors. In another sermon, he stated:\n",

I don't plan to run for any political office. I don't plan to do anything but remain a preacher.

Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s,[342] and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.[341]\n",

In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, \"Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.\"\n",

He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary.[362] Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson,[363] Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.[364][365]\n",
      "\n",
      "King was criticized by other black leaders in the civil rights movement. This included more militant thinkers such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X.[366] Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Ella Baker regarded King as a charismatic media figure who lost touch with the grassroots of the movement[367] as he became close to elite figures like Nelson Rockefeller.[368] Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker's, became a black separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture.[369][370] He also took issue that King's non-violence approach depended on appealing to America's conscience, feeling America had none to appeal to.[371]\n",
      "\n",
      "King was an avid supporter of Native American rights and Native Americans were active supporters of King's civil rights movement.[372] The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) was patterned after the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund.[373] The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was especially supportive in King's campaigns especially the Poor People's Campaign in 1968.[374] In King's book Why We Can't Wait he writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.[375]\n",
      "In the late 1950, the remaining Creek in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools. Light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride buses to previously all-white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from the same buses.[373] Tribal leaders, hearing of King's desegregation campaign in Birmingham, contacted him for assistance. Through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.[373]\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 1959, after giving a speech at the University of Arizona on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change, King stated his belief that one must not use force in this struggle \"but match the violence of his opponents with his suffering.\"[376] King then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by their photos; he wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Casper Glenn took King to the Papago Indian Reservation.[376] He met with all the tribal leaders, visited another Presbyterian church near the reservation, and preached there, attracting a Native American crowd.[376] He later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where he preached again to a Native American congregation.[376] King would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the 1963 March on Washington there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota and from the Navajo nation.[373][377]\n",
      "\n",
      "King was a major inspiration, along with the civil rights movement, of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s and many of its leaders.[373] John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe who was the executive director and a founder of the Native American Rights Fund, stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspired by Dr. King, who was advancing the civil rights agenda of equality under the laws of this country, we thought that we could also use the laws to advance our Indianship, to live as tribes in our territories governed by our own laws under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with us ever since 1831. We believed that we could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that we could govern our own affairs, define our own ways and continue to survive in this society.[378]\n",
      "As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: \"I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either.\"[379] In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, \"I don't think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses ... And I'm not inextricably bound to either party.\"[380] King did praise Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois as being the \"greatest of all senators\" because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes.[381]\n",
      "\n",
      "King critiqued both parties' performance on promoting racial equality:\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right-wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right-wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.[382]\n",
      "Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he had not decided whether he would vote for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II or Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1956 presidential election, but that \"In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket.\"[383] In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: \"I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one.\" King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying \"Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964.\"[384]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1964, King urged his supporters \"and all people of goodwill\" to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election \"would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.\"[385] King believed Robert F. Kennedy would make for a good president, but also believed that he wouldn't beat Johnson in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He also expressed support for the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Charles Percy. [386]\n",
      "\n",
      "King rejected both laissez-faire capitalism and communism; King had read Marx while at Morehouse but rejected communism because of its \"materialistic interpretation of history\" that denied religion, its \"ethical relativism\", and its \"political totalitarianism\". He stated that one focused too much on the individual while the other focused too much on the collective.[387] The American philosopher Tommie Shelby has described King as a social democrat who advocated for advocating economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal-democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented mixed economy.[388] However, he was often reluctant to speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of social democratic (\"socialist\") movements with communism. King believed that a laissez-faire economic system would not adequately provide the necessities of many American people, particularly African Americans.[226]\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, he said: \"I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic ...\"[389][390] In one speech, he stated that \"something is wrong with capitalism\" and said, \"There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\"[391] King further said that \"capitalism has outlived its usefulness\" and \"failed to meet the needs of the masses\".[392]\n",
      "\n",
      "King stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50 billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.[393]\n",
      "\n",
      "He posited that \"the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.\"[394] He presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, \"It should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.\"[395]\n",

      "Actress Nichelle Nichols planned to leave the science-fiction television series Star Trek in 1967 after its first season.[396] She changed her mind after talking to King,[397] who was a fan of the show. King explained that her character signified a future of greater racial cooperation.[398] King told Nichols, \"You are our image of where we're going, you're 300 years from now, and that means that's where we are and it takes place now. Keep doing what you're doing, you are our inspiration.\"[399] As Nichols recounted: \n",
      "Star Trek was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow their little children to watch. And I thanked him and I told him I was leaving the show. All the smile came off his face. And he said, 'Don't you understand for the first time we're seen as we should be seen. You don't have a black role. You have an equal role.'[396]\n",
      " The series' creator, Gene Roddenberry, was deeply moved upon learning of King's support.[400]\n",
      "\n",
      "FBI director J. Edgar Hoover personally ordered surveillance of King, with the intent to undermine his power as a civil rights leader.[401][402] The Church Committee, a 1975 investigation by the U.S. Congress, found that \"From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'neutralize' him as an effective civil rights leader.\"[403]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to proceed with wiretapping of King's phone lines, purportedly due to his association with Stanley Levison.[404] The Bureau informed President John F. Kennedy. He and his brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from Levison, a New York lawyer who had been involved with Communist Party USA.[405][406] Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's telephone lines \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\",[407] Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.[114]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Levison and King, and bugged King's rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country.[405][408] In 1967, Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: \"No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups ... to insure  [sic] the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited.\"[402][409]\n",
      "\n",
      "In a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who were critical of the U.S. war in Vietnam.[410] A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was \"disreputable if not outright illegal\".[410]\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, Hoover had been suspicious of potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights.[411] Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC when it was established.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the relationship between King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Levison was working as an \"agent of influence\" over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them.[412] Another King lieutenant, Jack O'Dell, was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).[413]\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the extensive surveillance, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.[403]\n",
      "\n",
      "For his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 Playboy interview, he stated that \"there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.\"[414] He argued that Hoover was \"following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South\" and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to \"aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements.\"[403] Hoover replied by saying that King was \"the most notorious liar in the country\".[415] After his \"I Have A Dream\" speech, the FBI described King as \"the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country\".[408] It alleged that he was \"knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists.\"[416]\n",
      "\n",
      "The attempts to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo but had been stirred up by \"communists\" and \"outside agitators\".[417] King said that \"the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals—the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations.\"[418]\n",
      "\n",
      "CIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation.[419] Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program HTLINGUAL.[420]\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI attempted to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he had numerous extramarital affairs.[408] The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King's family.[422] The bureau also sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information if he did not cease his civil rights work.[423] The FBI–King suicide letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part:\n",
      "\n",
      "The American public, the church organizations that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant  [sic]). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.[425]\n",
      "The letter was accompanied by a tape recording—excerpted from FBI wiretaps—of several of King's extramarital liaisons.[426] King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide,[427] although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to \"convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC.\"[403] King refused to succumb to the FBI's threats.[408]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1977, Judge John Lewis Smith Jr. ordered the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI's electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to sealed from public access in the National Archives until 2027.[428]\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2019, an FBI file emerged on which a handwritten note alleged that King \"looked on, laughed and offered advice\" as one of his friends raped a woman. Historians of the period who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed it as highly unreliable.[429][430] David Garrow, author of an earlier biography of King, wrote that \"the suggestion ... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible\".[431][430] Garrow's reliance on a handwritten note addended to a typed report is considered poor scholarship by several other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that Garrow was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of FBI reports during a period when the FBI was undertaking a massive operation to attempt to discredit King.[432] Experts in 20th-century American history, including Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis, the professors Barbara Ransby of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Nathan Connolly of Johns Hopkins University and Professor Emeritus of History Glenda Gilmore of Yale University have expressed reservations about Garrow's scholarship. Theoharis commented \"Most scholars I know would penalize graduate students for doing this.\" It is not the first time the care and rigor of Garrow's work has been called into serious question.[430] Clayborne Carson, Martin Luther King biographer and overseer of the Dr. King records at Stanford University states that he came to the opposite conclusion of Garrow: \n",
      "None of this is new. Garrow is talking about a recently added summary of a transcript of a 1964 recording from the Willard Hotel that others, including Mrs. King, have said they did not hear Martin's voice on it. The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report. You have to ask how could anyone conclude King looked at a rape from an audio recording in a room where he was not present.[433]\n",
      " The tapes that could confirm or refute the allegation are scheduled to be declassified in 2027.[434]\n",
      "\n",
      "In his 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down, Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a \"weakness for women\", although they \"all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.\"[435] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term \"womanizing\", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual.[436] Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs,[436] such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.[436]\n",
      "In his 1986 book Bearing the Cross, David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, \"that relationship ... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King's life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings ... of King's travels.\" He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as \"a form of anxiety reduction\". Garrow asserted that King's supposed promiscuity caused him \"painful and at times overwhelming guilt\".[437] King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that \"all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.\"[438] Shortly after Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow's allegations about King's sex life were \"sensational\" and stated that Garrow was \"amassing facts rather than analyzing them\".[439]\n",
      "\n",
      "A fire station was located across from the Lorraine Motel, next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying. Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance.[440] Agents were watching King at the time he was shot.[441] Immediately following the shooting, officers rushed to the motel. Marrell McCollough, an undercover police officer, was the first person to administer first aid to King.[442] The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.[443]\n",
      "\n",
      "King was awarded at least fifty honorary degrees from colleges and universities.[444] On October 14, 1964, King became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to him for leading nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in the U.S.[445][446] In 1965, he was awarded the American Liberties Medallion by the American Jewish Committee for his \"exceptional advancement of the principles of human liberty.\"[444][447] In his acceptance remarks, King said, \"Freedom is one thing. You have it all or you are not free.\"[448]\n",

      "Martin Luther King Jr. (born Michael King Jr.; January 15, 1929 – April 4, 1968) was an American Christian minister, activist, and political philosopher who was one of the most prominent leaders in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. A Black church leader and a son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through the use of nonviolent resistance and nonviolent civil disobedience against Jim Crow laws and other forms of legalized discrimination. \n",
      "\n",
      "King participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches during the 1965 Selma voting rights movement. The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic standoffs with segregationist authorities, who frequently responded violently. King was jailed several times. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963 forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life, and secretly recorded him. In 1964, the FBI mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance.  In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray, a fugitive from the Missouri State Penitentiary, was convicted of the assassination, though the King family believes he was a scapegoat; the assassination remains the subject of conspiracy theories. King's death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities. King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the federal holiday was first observed in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and King County in Washington was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was born Michael King Jr. on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia, the second of three children to Michael King Sr. and Alberta King (née Williams). King had an older sister, Christine King Farris, and a younger brother, Alfred Daniel \"A. D.\" King. Alberta's father, Adam Daniel Williams, was a minister in rural Georgia, moved to Atlanta in 1893, and became pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the following year. Williams married Jennie Celeste Parks. King Sr. was born to sharecroppers James Albert and Delia King of Stockbridge, Georgia, and was of African-Irish descent. As an adolescent, King Sr. left his parents' farm and walked to Atlanta, where he attained a high school education, and enrolled in Morehouse College to study for entry to the ministry. King Sr. and Alberta began dating in 1920, and married on November 25, 1926. Until Jennie's death in 1941, they lived together on the second floor of Alberta's parents' Victorian house, where King was born.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after marrying Alberta, King Sr. became assistant pastor of the Ebenezer church. Senior pastor Williams died in the spring of 1931 and, that fall, King Sr. took the role. With support from his wife, he would raise attendance from six hundred to several thousand. In 1934, the church sent King Sr. on a multinational trip, including to Berlin for the Congress of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA). He also visited sites in Germany that were associated with the Reformation leader Martin Luther. In reaction to the rise of Nazism, the BWA issued a resolution stating, \"This Congress deplores and condemns as a violation of the law of God the Heavenly Father, all racial animosity, and every form of oppression or unfair discrimination toward the Jews, toward colored people, or toward subject races in any part of the world.\" On returning home in August 1934, King Sr. changed his name to Martin Luther King Sr. and his five-year-old son's name to Martin Luther King Jr.[a]\n",
      "\n",
      "At his childhood home, King and his two siblings would read aloud the Bible as instructed by their father. After dinners, King's grandmother Jennie, whom he affectionately referred to as \"Mama\", would tell lively stories from the Bible. King's father would regularly use whippings to discipline his children, sometimes having them whip each other. King's father later remarked, \"[King] was the most peculiar child whenever you whipped him. He'd stand there, and the tears would run down, and he'd never cry.\" Once, when King witnessed his brother A.D. emotionally upset his sister Christine, he took a telephone and knocked out A.D. with it. When he and his brother were playing at their home, A.D. slid from a banister and hit Jennie, causing her to fall unresponsive. King, believing her dead, blamed himself and attempted suicide by jumping from a second-story window, but rose from the ground on hearing that she was alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "King became friends with a white boy whose father owned a business across the street from his home. In September 1935, when the boys were about six years old, they started school. King had to attend a school for black children, Yonge Street Elementary School, while his playmate went to a separate school for white children only. Soon afterwards, the parents of the white boy stopped allowing King to play with their son, stating to him, \"we are white, and you are colored\". When King relayed this to his parents, they discussed with him the history of slavery and racism in America, which King would later state made him \"determined to hate every white person\". His parents instructed him that it was his Christian duty to love everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "King witnessed his father stand up against segregation and discrimination. Once, when stopped by a police officer who referred to King Sr. as \"boy\", King's father responded sharply that King Jr. was a boy but he was a man. When King's father took him into a shoe store in downtown Atlanta, the clerk told them they needed to sit in the back. King's father refused, stating \"we'll either buy shoes sitting here or we won't buy any shoes at all\", before leaving the store with King. He told King afterward, \"I don't care how long I have to live with this system, I will never accept it.\" In 1936, King's father led hundreds of African Americans in a civil rights march to the city hall in Atlanta, to protest voting rights discrimination. King later remarked that King Sr. was \"a real father\" to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "King memorized hymns and Bible verses by the time he was five years old. Over the next year, he began to go to church events with his mother and sing hymns while she played piano. His favorite hymn was \"I Want to Be More and More Like Jesus\"; he moved attendees with his singing. King later became a member of the junior choir in his church. King enjoyed opera, and played the piano. King garnered a large vocabulary from reading dictionaries. He got into physical altercations with boys in his neighborhood, but oftentimes used his knowledge of words to stymie fights. King showed a lack of interest in grammar and spelling, a trait that persisted throughout his life. In 1939, King sang as a member of his church choir in slave costume, for the all-white audience at the Atlanta premiere of the film Gone with the Wind. In September 1940, at the age of 11, King was enrolled at the Atlanta University Laboratory School for the seventh grade. While there, King took violin and piano lessons, and showed keen interest in history and English classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 18, 1941, when King had sneaked away from studying at home to watch a parade, he was informed that something had happened to his maternal grandmother. Upon returning home, he learned she had a heart attack and died while being transported to a hospital. He took the death very hard and believed that his deception of going to see the parade may have been responsible for God taking her. King jumped out of a second-story window at his home, but again survived. His father instructed him that King should not blame himself, and that she had been called home to God as part of God's plan. King struggled with this. Shortly thereafter, King's father decided to move the family to a two-story brick home on a hill overlooking downtown Atlanta.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an adolescent, he initially felt resentment against whites due to the \"racial humiliation\" that he, his family, and his neighbors often had to endure. In 1942, when King was 13, he became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal. That year, King skipped the ninth grade and was enrolled in Booker T. Washington High School, where he maintained a B-plus average. The high school was the only one in the city for African-American students.\n",
      "\n",
      "While King was brought up in a Baptist home, as he entered adolescence he began to question the literalist teachings preached at his father's church. At the age of 13, he denied the bodily resurrection of Jesus during Sunday school. King said that he found himself unable to identify with the emotional displays from congregants frequent at his church, and doubted if he would ever attain personal satisfaction from religion. He later stated of this point in his life, \"doubts began to spring forth unrelentingly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In high school, King became known for his public-speaking ability, with a voice that had grown into an orotund baritone. He joined the school's debate team. King continued to be most drawn to history and English, and chose English and sociology as his main subjects. King maintained an abundant vocabulary. However, he relied on his sister Christine to help him with spelling, while King assisted her with math. King also developed an interest in fashion, commonly wearing polished patent leather shoes and tweed suits, which gained him the nickname \"Tweed\" or \"Tweedie\" among his friends. He liked flirting with girls and dancing. His brother A.D. later remarked, \"He kept flitting from chick to chick, and I decided I couldn't keep up with him. Especially since he was crazy about dances, and just about the best jitterbug in town.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 13, 1944, in his junior year, King gave his first public speech during an oratorical contest. In his speech he stated, \"black America still wears chains. The finest negro is at the mercy of the meanest white man.\" King was selected as the winner of the contest. On the ride home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit. The driver of the bus called King a \"black son-of-a-bitch\". King initially refused but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not. As all the seats were occupied, he and his teacher were forced to stand the rest of the way to Atlanta. Later King wrote of the incident: \"That night will never leave my memory. It was the angriest I have ever been in my life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "During King's junior year in high school, Morehouse College—an all-male historically black college that King's father and maternal grandfather had attended—began accepting high school juniors who passed the entrance examination. As World War II was underway many black college students had been enlisted, so the university aimed to increase their enrolment by allowing juniors to apply. In 1944, aged 15, King passed the examination and was enrolled at the university that autumn.[b]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summer before King started at Morehouse, he boarded a train with his friend—Emmett \"Weasel\" Proctor—and a group of other Morehouse College students to work in Simsbury, Connecticut, at the tobacco farm of Cullman Brothers Tobacco. This was King's first trip into the integrated north. In a June 1944 letter to his father King wrote about the differences that struck him: \"On our way here we saw some things I had never anticipated to see. After we passed Washington there was no discrimination at all. The white people here are very nice. We go to any place we want to and sit anywhere we want to.\" The farm had partnered with Morehouse College to allot their salaries towards the university's tuition, housing, and fees. On weekdays King and the other students worked in the fields, picking tobacco from 7:00am to at least 5:00pm, enduring temperatures above 100 °F, to earn roughly USD$4 per day. On Friday evenings, the students visited downtown Simsbury to get milkshakes and watch movies, and on Saturdays they would travel to Hartford, Connecticut, to see theatre performances, shop and eat in restaurants. On Sundays they attended church services in Hartford, at a church filled with white congregants. King wrote to his parents about the lack of segregation, relaying how he was amazed they could go to \"one of the finest restaurants in Hartford\" and that \"Negroes and whites go to the same church\".\n",
      "\n",
      "He played freshman football there. The summer before his last year at Morehouse, in 1947, the 18-year-old King chose to enter the ministry. He would later credit the college's president, Baptist minister Benjamin Mays, with being his \"spiritual mentor\". King had concluded that the church offered the most assuring way to answer \"an inner urge to serve humanity\", and he made peace with the Baptist Church, as he believed he would be a \"rational\" minister with sermons that were \"a respectful force for ideas, even social protest.\" King graduated from Morehouse with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 1948, aged nineteen.\n",
      "\n",
      "King enrolled in Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania, and took several courses at the University of Pennsylvania. At Crozer, King was elected president of the student body. At Penn, King took courses with William Fontaine, Penn's first African-American professor, and Elizabeth F. Flower, a professor of philosophy. King's father supported his decision to continue his education and made arrangements for King to work with J. Pius Barbour, a family friend and Crozer alumnus who pastored at Calvary Baptist Church in nearby Chester, Pennsylvania. King became known as one of the \"Sons of Calvary\", an honor he shared with William Augustus Jones Jr. and Samuel D. Proctor, who both went on to become well-known preachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "King once reproved another student for keeping beer in his room, saying they shared responsibility as African Americans to bear \"the burdens of the Negro race\". For a time, he was interested in Walter Rauschenbusch's \"social gospel\". In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with the white daughter of an immigrant German woman who worked in the cafeteria. King planned to marry her, but friends, as well as King's father, advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites, potentially damaging his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage and broke the relationship off six months later. One friend was quoted as saying, \"He never recovered.\" Other friends, including Harry Belafonte, said Betty had been \"the love of King's life.\" King graduated with a Bachelor of Divinity in 1951. He applied to the University of Edinburgh for a doctorate in the School of Divinity but ultimately chose Boston instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1951, King began doctoral studies in systematic theology at Boston University, and worked as an assistant minister at Boston's historic Twelfth Baptist Church with William Hunter Hester. Hester was an old friend of King's father and was an important influence on King. In Boston, King befriended a small cadre of local ministers his age, and sometimes guest pastored at their churches, including Michael Haynes, associate pastor at Twelfth Baptist Church in Roxbury. The young men often held bull sessions in their apartments, discussing theology, sermon style, and social issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the age of 25 in 1954, King was called as pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. King received his PhD on June 5, 1955, with a dissertation (initially supervised by Edgar S. Brightman and, upon the latter's death, by Lotan Harold DeWolf) titled A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman.\n",
      "\n",
      "An academic inquiry in October 1991 concluded that portions of his doctoral dissertation had been plagiarized and he had acted improperly. However, \"[d]espite its finding, the committee said that 'no thought should be given to the revocation of Dr. King's doctoral degree,' an action that the panel said would serve no purpose.\" The committee found that the dissertation still \"makes an intelligent contribution to scholarship.\" A letter is now attached to the copy of King's dissertation in the university library, noting that numerous passages were included without the appropriate quotations and citations of sources. Significant debate exists on how to interpret King's plagiarism.\n",
      "\n",
      "While studying at Boston University, he asked a friend from Atlanta named Mary Powell, a student at the New England Conservatory of Music, if she knew any nice Southern girls. Powell spoke to fellow student Coretta Scott; Scott was not interested in dating preachers but eventually agreed to allow King to telephone her based on Powell's description and vouching. On their first call, King told Scott, \"I am like Napoleon at Waterloo before your charms,\" to which she replied, \"You haven't even met me.\" King married Scott on June 18, 1953, on the lawn of her parents' house, in Heiberger, Alabama. They had four children: Yolanda King (1955–2007), Martin Luther King III (b. 1957), Dexter Scott King (1961–2024), and Bernice King (b. 1963). King limited Coretta's role in the civil rights movement, expecting her to be a housewife and mother.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dexter Avenue Baptist Church was influential in the Montgomery African-American community. As the church's pastor, King became known for his oratorical preaching in Montgomery and the surrounding region.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 1955, Claudette Colvin—a fifteen-year-old black schoolgirl in Montgomery—refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in violation of Jim Crow laws, local laws in the Southern United States that enforced racial segregation. Nine months later on December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus. The two incidents led to the Montgomery bus boycott, which was urged and planned by Edgar Nixon and led by King. The other ministers asked him to take a leadership role because his relative newness to community leadership made it easier for him to speak out. King was hesitant but decided to do so if no one else wanted it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the situation became so tense that King's house was bombed. King was arrested for traveling 30 mph in a 25 mph zone and jailed, which overnight drew the attention of national media, and greatly increased King's public stature. The controversy ended when the United States District Court issued a ruling in Browder v. Gayle that prohibited racial segregation on Montgomery public buses.\n",
      "\n",
      "King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1957, King, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Joseph Lowery, and other civil rights activists founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). The group was created to harness the moral authority and organizing power of black churches to conduct nonviolent protests in the service of civil rights reform. The group was inspired by the crusades of evangelist Billy Graham, who befriended King, as well as the national organizing of the group In Friendship, founded by King allies Stanley Levison and Ella Baker. King led the SCLC until his death. The SCLC's 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom was the first time King addressed a national audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harry Wachtel joined King's legal advisor Clarence B. Jones in defending four ministers of the SCLC in the libel case Abernathy et al. v. Sullivan; the case was litigated about the newspaper advertisement \"Heed Their Rising Voices\". Wachtel founded a tax-exempt fund to cover the suit's expenses and assist the nonviolent civil rights movement through a more effective means of fundraising. King served as honorary president of this organization, named the \"Gandhi Society for Human Rights\". In 1962, King and the Gandhi Society produced a document that called on President Kennedy to issue an executive order to deliver a blow for civil rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order. The FBI, under written directive from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, began tapping King's telephone line in the fall of 1963. Kennedy was concerned that public allegations of communists in the SCLC would derail the administration's civil rights initiatives. He warned King to discontinue these associations and later felt compelled to issue the written directive that authorized the FBI to wiretap King and other SCLC leaders. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover feared the civil rights movement and investigated the allegations of communist infiltration. When no evidence emerged to support this, the FBI used the incidental details caught on tape over the next five years, as part of its COINTELPRO program, in attempts to force King out of his leadership position.\n",
      "\n",
      "King believed that organized, nonviolent protest against the system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive media coverage of the struggle for black equality. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily indignities suffered by southern blacks, and of segregationist violence and harassment of civil rights supporters, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the civil rights movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.\n",
      "\n",
      "King organized and led marches for blacks' right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other basic civil rights. Most of these rights were successfully enacted into law with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SCLC used tactics of nonviolent protest with great success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were often dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 20, 1958, King was signing copies of his book Stride Toward Freedom in Blumstein's department store in Harlem when Izola Curry—a mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communists—stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener, which nearly impinged on the aorta. King received first aid by police officers Al Howard and Philip Romano. King underwent emergency surgery by Aubre de Lambert Maynard, Emil Naclerio and John W. V. Cordice; he remained hospitalized for several weeks. Curry was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 1959, after being based in Montgomery for five years, King announced his return to Atlanta at the request of the SCLC. In Atlanta, King served until his death as co-pastor with his father at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver expressed open hostility towards King's return. He claimed that \"wherever M. L. King Jr., has been there has followed in his wake a wave of crimes\", and vowed to keep King under surveillance. On May 4, 1960, King drove writer Lillian Smith to Emory University when police stopped them. King was cited for \"driving without a license\" because he had not yet been issued a Georgia license. King's Alabama license was still valid, and Georgia law did not mandate any time limit for issuing a local license. King paid a fine but was unaware that his lawyer agreed to a plea deal that included probation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Atlanta Student Movement had been acting to desegregate businesses and public spaces, organizing the Atlanta sit-ins from March 1960 onwards. In August the movement asked King to participate in a mass October sit-in, timed to highlight how 1960's Presidential election campaign had ignored civil rights. The coordinated day of action took place on October 19. King participated in a sit-in at the restaurant inside Rich's, Atlanta's largest department store, and was among the many arrested that day. The authorities released everyone over the next few days, except for King. Invoking his probationary plea deal, judge J. Oscar Mitchell sentenced King on October 25 to four months of hard labor. Before dawn the next day, King was transported to Georgia State Prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrest and harsh sentence drew nationwide attention. Many feared for King's safety, as he started a prison sentence with people convicted of violent crimes, many of them White and hostile to his activism. Both Presidential candidates were asked to weigh in, at a time when both parties were courting the support of Southern Whites and their political leadership including Governor Vandiver. Nixon, with whom King had a closer relationship before, declined to make a statement despite a personal visit from Jackie Robinson requesting his intervention. Nixon's opponent John F. Kennedy called the governor (a Democrat) directly, enlisted his brother Robert to exert more pressure on state authorities, and, at the personal request of Sargent Shriver, called King's wife to offer his help. The pressure from Kennedy and others proved effective, and King was released two days later. King's father decided to openly endorse Kennedy's candidacy for the November 8 election which he narrowly won.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the October 19 sit-ins and following unrest, a 30-day truce was declared in Atlanta for desegregation negotiations. However, the negotiations failed and sit-ins and boycotts resumed for several months. On March 7, 1961, a group of Black elders including King notified student leaders that a deal had been reached: the city's lunch counters would desegregate in fall 1961, in conjunction with the court-mandated desegregation of schools. Many students were disappointed at the compromise. In a large meeting on March 10 at Warren Memorial Methodist Church, the audience was hostile and frustrated. King then gave an impassioned speech calling participants to resist the \"cancerous disease of disunity\", helping to calm tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Albany Movement was a desegregation coalition formed in Albany, Georgia, in November 1961. In December, King and the SCLC became involved. The movement mobilized thousands of citizens for a nonviolent attack on every aspect of segregation in the city and attracted nationwide attention. When King first visited on December 15, 1961, he \"had planned to stay a day or so and return home after giving counsel.\" The following day he was swept up in a mass arrest of peaceful demonstrators, and he declined bail until the city made concessions. According to King, \"that agreement was dishonored and violated by the city\" after he left.\n",
      "\n",
      "King returned in July 1962 and was given the option of forty-five days in jail or a $178 fine (equivalent to $1,700 in 2022); he chose jail. Three days into his sentence, Police Chief Laurie Pritchett discreetly arranged for King's fine to be paid and ordered his release. \"We had witnessed persons being kicked off lunch counter stools ... ejected from churches ... and thrown into jail ... But for the first time, we witnessed being kicked out of jail.\" It was later acknowledged by the King Center that Billy Graham was the one who bailed King out.\n",
      "\n",
      "After nearly a year of intense activism with few tangible results, the movement began to deteriorate. King requested a halt to all demonstrations and a \"Day of Penance\" to promote nonviolence and maintain the moral high ground. Divisions within the black community and the canny, low-key response by local government defeated efforts. Though the Albany effort proved a key lesson in tactics for King and the national civil rights movement, the national media was highly critical of King's role in the defeat, and the SCLC's lack of results contributed to a growing gulf between the organization and the more radical SNCC. After Albany, King sought to choose engagements for the SCLC in which he could control the circumstances, rather than entering into pre-existing situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In April 1963, the SCLC began a campaign against racial segregation and economic injustice in Birmingham, Alabama. The campaign used nonviolent but intentionally confrontational tactics, developed in part by Wyatt Tee Walker. Black people in Birmingham, organizing with the SCLC, occupied public spaces with marches and sit-ins, openly violating laws that they considered unjust.\n",
      "\n",
      "King's intent was to provoke mass arrests and \"create a situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation.\" The campaign's early volunteers did not succeed in shutting down the city, or in drawing media attention to the police's actions. Over the concerns of an uncertain King, SCLC strategist James Bevel changed the course of the campaign by recruiting children and young adults to join the demonstrations. Newsweek called this strategy a Children's Crusade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police dogs against protesters, including children. Footage of the police response was broadcast on national television news, shocking many white Americans and consolidating black Americans behind the movement. Not all of the demonstrators were peaceful, despite the avowed intentions of the SCLC. In some cases, bystanders attacked the police, who responded with force. King and the SCLC were criticized for putting children in harm's way. But the campaign was a success: Connor lost his job, the \"Jim Crow\" signs came down, and public places became more open to blacks. King's reputation improved immensely.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was arrested and jailed early in the campaign—his 13th arrest out of 29. From his cell, he composed the now-famous \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" that responds to calls to pursue legal channels for social change. The letter has been described as \"one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner\". King argues that the crisis of racism is too urgent, and the current system too entrenched: \"We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.\" He points out that the Boston Tea Party, a celebrated act of rebellion in the American colonies, was illegal civil disobedience, and that, conversely, \"everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was 'legal'.\" Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged for $160,000 to bail out King and his fellow protestors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "—Martin Luther King Jr.\n",
      "King, representing the SCLC, was among the leaders of the \"Big Six\" civil rights organizations who were instrumental in the organization of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which took place on August 28, 1963. The other leaders and organizations comprising the Big Six were Roy Wilkins from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; Whitney Young, National Urban League; A. Philip Randolph, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis, SNCC; and James L. Farmer Jr., Congress of Racial Equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bayard Rustin's open homosexuality, support of socialism, and former ties to the Communist Party USA caused many white and African-American leaders to demand King distance himself from Rustin, which King agreed to do. However, he did collaborate in the 1963 March on Washington, for which Rustin was the primary organizer. For King, this role was another which courted controversy, since he was one of the key figures who acceded to the wishes of President Kennedy in changing the focus of the march. Kennedy initially opposed the march outright, because he was concerned it would negatively impact the drive for passage of civil rights legislation. However, the organizers were firm that the march would proceed. With the march going forward, the Kennedys decided it was important to ensure its success. President Kennedy was concerned the turnout would be less than 100,000 and enlisted the aid of additional church leaders and Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers, to help mobilize demonstrators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The march originally was planned to dramatize the desperate condition of blacks in the southern U.S. and place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. The group acquiesced to presidential pressure, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone. As a result, some civil rights activists felt it presented an inaccurate, sanitized pageant of racial harmony; Malcolm X called it the \"Farce on Washington\", and the Nation of Islam forbade its members from attending.\n",
      "\n",
      "The march made specific demands: an end to racial segregation in public schools; meaningful civil rights legislation, including a law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment; protection of civil rights workers from police brutality; a $2 minimum wage for all workers (equivalent to $19 in 2022); and self-government for Washington, D.C., then governed by congressional committee. Despite tensions, the march was a resounding success. More than a quarter of a million people of diverse ethnicities attended, sprawling from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial onto the National Mall. At the time, it was the largest gathering of protesters in Washington, D.C.'s history.\n",
      "\n",
      "King delivered a 17-minute speech, later known as \"I Have a Dream\". In the speech's most famous passage – in which he departed from his prepared text, possibly at the prompting of Mahalia Jackson, who shouted behind him, \"Tell them about the dream!\" – King said:\n",
      "\n",
      "I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a dream today.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a dream today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I Have a Dream\" came to be regarded as one of the finest speeches in the history of American oratory. The March, and especially King's speech, helped put civil rights at the top of the agenda of reformers and facilitated passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with Robert Hayling's then-controversial movement in St. Augustine, Florida. Hayling's group had been affiliated with the NAACP but was forced out of the organization for advocating armed self-defense alongside nonviolent tactics. However, the pacifist SCLC accepted them. King and the SCLC worked to bring white Northern activists to St. Augustine, including a delegation of rabbis and the 72-year-old mother of the governor of Massachusetts, all of whom were arrested. During June, the movement marched nightly through the city, \"often facing counter demonstrations by the Klan, and provoking violence that garnered national media attention.\" Hundreds of the marchers were arrested and jailed. During this movement, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 7, 1964, King spoke at Saint Francis College's \"The Negro and the Quest for Identity\", in Biddeford, Maine. This was a symposium that brought together many civil rights leaders. King spoke about how \"We must get rid of the idea of superior and inferior races,\" through nonviolent tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "On February 6, 1964, King delivered the inaugural speech of a lecture series initiated at the New School called \"The American Race Crisis\". In his remarks, King referred to a conversation he had recently had with Jawaharlal Nehru in which he compared the sad condition of many African Americans to that of India's untouchables. In his March 18, 1964, interview with Robert Penn Warren, King compared his activism to his father's, citing his training in non-violence as a key difference. He also discusses the next phase of the civil rights movement and integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting in November 1964, King supported a labor strike by several hundred workers at the Scripto factory in Atlanta, just a few blocks from Ebenezer Baptist. Many of the strikers were congregants of his church, and the strike was supported by other civil rights leaders. King helped elevate the labor dispute from a local to nationally known event and led the SCLC to organize a nationwide boycott of Scripto products. However, as the strike stretched into December, King, who was wanting to focus more on a civil rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, began to negotiate in secret with Scripto's president Carl Singer and eventually brokered a deal where the SCLC would call off their boycott in exchange for the company giving the striking employees their Christmas bonuses. King's involvement in the strike ended on December 24 and a contract between the company and union was signed on January 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 1964, King and the SCLC joined forces with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Selma, Alabama, where the SNCC had been working on voter registration for several months. A local judge issued an injunction that barred any gathering of three or more people affiliated with the SNCC, SCLC, DCVL, or any of 41 named civil rights leaders. This injunction temporarily halted civil rights activity until King defied it by speaking at Brown Chapel on January 2, 1965. During the 1965 march to Montgomery, Alabama, violence by state police and others against the peaceful marchers resulted in much publicity, which made racism in Alabama visible nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acting on James Bevel's call for a march from Selma to Montgomery, Bevel and other SCLC members, in partial collaboration with SNCC, attempted to organize a march to the state's capital. The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, at which King was not present, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day has become known as Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support for the civil rights movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King and Bevel's nonviolence strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 5, King met with officials in the Johnson Administration to request an injunction against any prosecution of the demonstrators. He did not attend the march due to church duties, but he later wrote, \"If I had any idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line.\" Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.\n",
      "\n",
      "King next attempted to organize a march for March 9. The SCLC petitioned for an injunction in federal court against Alabama; this was denied and the judge issued an order blocking the march until after a hearing. Nonetheless, King led marchers on March 9 to the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, then held a short prayer session before turning the marchers around and asking them to disperse so as not to violate the court order. The unexpected ending of this second march aroused the surprise and anger of many within the local movement. The march finally went ahead fully on March 25, 1965. At the conclusion of the march on the steps of the state capitol, King delivered a speech that became known as \"How Long, Not Long\". King stated that equal rights for African Americans could not be far away, \"because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\" and \"you shall reap what you sow\".[c]\n",

      "In 1966, after several successes in the south, King, Bevel, and others in the civil rights organizations took the movement to the North. King and Ralph Abernathy, both from the middle class, moved into a building at 1550 S. Hamlin Avenue, in the slums of North Lawndale on Chicago's West Side, as an educational experience and to demonstrate their support and empathy for the poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SCLC formed a coalition with Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), an organization founded by Albert Raby, and the combined organizations' efforts were fostered under the aegis of the Chicago Freedom Movement.\n",
      "During that spring, several white couple/black couple tests of real estate offices uncovered racial steering, discriminatory processing of housing requests by couples who were exact matches in income and background. Several larger marches were planned and executed: in Bogan, Belmont Cragin, Jefferson Park, Evergreen Park, Gage Park, Marquette Park, and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "King later stated and Abernathy wrote that the movement received a worse reception in Chicago than in the South. Marches, especially the one through Marquette Park on August 5, 1966, were met by thrown bottles and screaming throngs. Rioting seemed very possible. King's beliefs militated against his staging a violent event, and he negotiated an agreement with Mayor Richard J. Daley to cancel a march in order to avoid the violence that he feared would result. King was hit by a brick during one march, but continued to lead marches in the face of personal danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "When King and his allies returned to the South, they left Jesse Jackson, a seminary student who had previously joined the movement in the South, in charge of their organization. Jackson continued their struggle for civil rights by organizing the Operation Breadbasket movement that targeted chain stores that did not deal fairly with blacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 1967 CIA document declassified in 2017 downplayed King's role in the \"black militant situation\" in Chicago, with a source stating that King \"sought at least constructive, positive projects.\"\n",

      "The black revolution is much more than a struggle for the rights of Negroes. It is forcing America to face all its interrelated flaws—racism, poverty, militarism, and materialism. It is exposing evils that are rooted deeply in the whole structure of our society. It reveals systemic rather than superficial flaws and suggests that radical reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced\n",
      "\n",
      "–Martin Luther King Jr.\n",
      "We must recognize that we can't solve our problem now until there is a radical redistribution of economic and political power... this means a revolution of values and other things. We must see now that the evils of racism, economic exploitation, and militarism are all tied together… you can't really get rid of one without getting rid of the others… the whole structure of American life must be changed. America is a hypocritical nation and [we] must put [our] own house in order.\n",
      "\n",
      "—Martin Luther King Jr.\n",
      "King was long opposed to American involvement in the Vietnam War, but at first avoided the topic in public speeches to avoid the interference with civil rights goals that criticism of President Johnson's policies might have created. At the urging of SCLC's former Director of Direct Action and now the head of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, James Bevel, and inspired by the outspokenness of Muhammad Ali, King eventually agreed to publicly oppose the war as opposition was growing among the American public.\n",
      "\n",
      "During an April 4, 1967, appearance at the New York City Riverside Church, King delivered a speech titled \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time to Break Silence\". He spoke strongly against the U.S.'s role in the war, arguing that the U.S. was in Vietnam \"to occupy it as an American colony\" and calling the U.S. government \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today\". He connected the war with economic injustice, arguing that the country needed serious moral change:\n",
      "\n",
      "A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say: \"This is not just.\" \n",
      "King opposed the Vietnam War because it took money and resources that could have been spent on social welfare at home. He summed up this aspect by saying, \"A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.\" He stated that North Vietnam \"did not begin to send in any large number of supplies or men until American forces had arrived in the tens of thousands\", and accused the U.S. of having killed a million Vietnamese, \"mostly children\". King also criticized American opposition to North Vietnam's land reforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "King's opposition cost him significant support among white allies, including President Johnson, Billy Graham, union leaders and powerful publishers. \"The press is being stacked against me\", King said, complaining of what he described as a double standard that applauded his nonviolence at home, but deplored it when applied \"toward little brown Vietnamese children\". Life magazine called the speech \"demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi\", and The Washington Post declared that King had \"diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech reflected King's evolving political advocacy in his later years, which paralleled the teachings of the progressive Highlander Research and Education Center, with which he was affiliated. King began to speak of the need for fundamental changes in the American political and economic situation, and more frequently expressed his opposition to the war and his desire to see a redistribution of resources to correct injustice. He guarded his language in public to avoid being linked to communism, but in private he sometimes spoke of his support for democratic socialism.\n",
      "\n",
      "King stated in \"Beyond Vietnam\" that \"true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar ... it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.\" King quoted a U.S. official who said that from Vietnam to Latin America, the country was \"on the wrong side of a world revolution.\" King condemned America's \"alliance with the landed gentry of Latin America\", and said that the U.S. should support \"the shirtless and barefoot people\" in the Third World rather than suppressing their attempts at revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "King's stance on Vietnam encouraged Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, with the support of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal as he felt uneasy with politics and considered himself better suited to activism.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 15, 1967, King spoke at an anti-war march from Manhattan's Central Park to the United Nations. The march was organized by the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam under chairman James Bevel. At the U.N. King brought up issues of civil rights and the draft:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have not urged a mechanical fusion of the civil rights and peace movements. There are people who have come to see the moral imperative of equality, but who cannot yet see the moral imperative of world brotherhood. I would like to see the fervor of the civil-rights movement imbued into the peace movement to instill it with greater strength. And I believe everyone has a duty to be in both the civil-rights and peace movements. But for those who presently choose but one, I would hope they will finally come to see the moral roots common to both.\n",
      "Seeing an opportunity to unite civil rights and anti-war activists, Bevel convinced King to become even more active in the anti-war effort. Despite his growing public opposition to the Vietnam War, King was not fond of the hippie culture which developed from the anti-war movement. In his 1967 Massey Lecture, King stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "The importance of the hippies is not in their unconventional behavior, but in the fact that hundreds of thousands of young people, in turning to a flight from reality, are expressing a profoundly discrediting view on the society they emerge from.\n",
      "On January 13, 1968, King called for a large march on Washington against \"one of history's most cruel and senseless wars\":\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to make clear in this political year, to congressmen on both sides of the aisle and to the president of the United States, that we will no longer tolerate, we will no longer vote for men who continue to see the killings of Vietnamese and Americans as the best way of advancing the goals of freedom and self-determination in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "Thích Nhất Hạnh was an influential Vietnamese Buddhist who wrote a letter to Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965 entitled: \"In Search of the Enemy of Man\". It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War. In 1967, King gave a famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination, King said, \"I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [this prize] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1968, King and the SCLC organized the \"Poor People's Campaign\" to address issues of economic justice. King traveled the country to assemble \"a multiracial army of the poor\" that would march on Washington to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience at the Capitol until Congress created an \"economic bill of rights\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign was preceded by King's final book, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? which laid out his view of how to address social issues and poverty. King quoted from Henry George's book Progress and Poverty, particularly in support of a guaranteed basic income. The campaign culminated in a march on Washington, D.C., demanding economic aid to the poorest communities of the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "King and the SCLC called on the government to invest in rebuilding America's cities. He felt that Congress had shown \"hostility to the poor\" by spending \"military funds with alacrity and generosity\". He contrasted this with the situation faced by poor Americans, claiming that Congress had merely provided \"poverty funds with miserliness\". His vision was for change that was more revolutionary than mere reform: he cited systematic flaws of \"racism, poverty, militarism and materialism\", and argued that \"reconstruction of society itself is the real issue to be faced.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Poor People's Campaign was controversial even within the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that the goals of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and that he thought that these campaigns would accelerate repression on the poor and the black.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, in 1968 a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 29, 1968, King went to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of the black sanitation workers, who were represented by AFSCME Local 1733. The workers had been on strike since March 12 for higher wages and better treatment. In one incident, black street repairmen received pay for two hours when they were sent home because of bad weather, but white employees were paid for the full day.\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 3, King addressed a rally and delivered his \"I've Been to the Mountaintop\" address at Mason Temple. King's flight to Memphis had been delayed by a bomb threat against his plane. In reference to the bomb threat, King said:\n",
      "\n",
      "And then I got to Memphis. And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out. What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?\n",
      "Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop. And I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\n",
      "King was booked in Room 306 at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Ralph Abernathy, who was present at the assassination, testified to the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations that King and his entourage stayed at Room 306 so often that it was known as the \"King-Abernathy suite\". According to Jesse Jackson, who was present, King's last words were spoken to musician Ben Branch, who was scheduled to perform that night at an event King was attending: \"Ben, make sure you play 'Take My Hand, Precious Lord' in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "King was fatally shot by James Earl Ray at 6:01 p.m., Thursday, April 4, 1968, as he stood on the motel's second-floor balcony. The bullet entered through his right cheek, smashing his jaw, then traveled down his spinal cord before lodging in his shoulder. Abernathy heard the shot from inside the motel room and ran to the balcony to find King on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "After emergency surgery, King died at St. Joseph's Hospital at 7:05 p.m. According to biographer Taylor Branch, King's autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he \"had the heart of a 60 year old\", which Branch attributed to stress. King was initially interred in South View Cemetery in South Atlanta, but in 1977, his remains were transferred to a tomb on the site of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "The assassination led to race riots in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Baltimore, Louisville, Kansas City, and dozens of other cities. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy was on his way to Indianapolis for a campaign rally when he was informed of King's death. He gave a short, improvised speech to the gathering of supporters informing them of the tragedy and urging them to continue King's ideal of nonviolence. The following day, he delivered a prepared response in Cleveland. James Farmer Jr. and other civil rights leaders also called for non-violent action, while the more militant Stokely Carmichael called for a more forceful response. The city of Memphis quickly settled the strike on terms favorable to the sanitation workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan to set up a shantytown in Washington, D.C., was carried out soon after the April 4 assassination. Criticism of King's plan was subdued in the wake of his death, and the SCLC received an unprecedented wave of donations to carry it out. The campaign officially began in Memphis, on May 2, at the hotel where King was murdered. Thousands of demonstrators arrived on the National Mall and stayed for six weeks, establishing a camp they called \"Resurrection City\".\n",
      "\n",
      "President Johnson tried to quell the riots by making telephone calls to civil rights leaders, mayors and governors across the United States and told politicians that they should warn the police against the unwarranted use of force. However, \"I'm not getting through,\" Johnson told his aides. \"They're all holing up like generals in a dugout getting ready to watch a war.\" Johnson declared April 7 a national day of mourning for King.\n",
      "Vice President Hubert Humphrey attended King's funeral on behalf of the President, as there were fears that Johnson's presence might incite protests and perhaps violence. At his widow's request, King's last sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, given on February 4, 1968, was played at the funeral:\n",

      "I'd like somebody to mention that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to give his life serving others. I'd like for somebody to say that day that Martin Luther King Jr. tried to love somebody.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want you to say that day that I tried to be right on the war question. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try to feed the hungry. I want you to be able to say that day that I did try in my life to clothe those who were naked. I want you to say on that day that I did try in my life to visit those who were in prison. And I want you to say that I tried to love and serve humanity.\n",

      "Yes, if you want to say that I was a drum major. Say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter. I won't have any money to leave behind. I won't have the fine and luxurious things of life to leave behind. But I just want to leave a committed life behind.\n",
      "His good friend Mahalia Jackson sang his favorite hymn, \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\", at the funeral. The assassination helped to spur the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1968.\n",
      "Two months after King's death, James Earl Ray—on the loose from a previous prison escape—was captured at London Heathrow Airport while trying to reach white-ruled Rhodesia on a false Canadian passport. He was using the alias Ramon George Sneyd. Ray was quickly extradited to Tennessee and charged with King's murder. He confessed on March 10, 1969, though he recanted this confession three days later. On the advice of his attorney Percy Foreman, Ray pleaded guilty to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term. Ray later claimed a man he met in Montreal, Quebec, with the alias \"Raoul\" was involved and that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy. He spent the remainder of his life attempting, unsuccessfully, to withdraw his guilty plea and secure the trial he never had. Ray died in 1998 at age 70.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ray's lawyers maintained he was a scapegoat similar to the way that John F. Kennedy's assassin Lee Harvey Oswald is seen by conspiracy theorists. Supporters of this assertion said that Ray's confession was given under pressure and that he had been threatened with the death penalty. They admitted that Ray was a thief and burglar, but claimed that he had no record of committing violent crimes with a weapon. However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for armed robbery. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. \"I never been with nobody as bold as he is,\" Jerry said. \"He just walked in and put that gun on somebody, it was just like it's an everyday thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Those suspecting a conspiracy point to the two successive ballistics tests which proved that a rifle similar to Ray's Remington Gamemaster had been the murder weapon. Those tests did not implicate Ray's specific rifle. Witnesses near King said that the shot came from another location, from behind thick shrubbery near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm at the time of the assassination.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1997, King's son Dexter Scott King met with Ray, and publicly supported Ray's efforts to obtain a new trial. Two years later, King's widow Coretta Scott King and the couple's children, represented by William F. Pepper, won a wrongful death claim against Loyd Jowers and \"other unknown co-conspirators\". Jowers claimed to have received $100,000 to arrange King's assassination. The jury found Jowers to be complicit in a conspiracy and that government agencies were party to the assassination. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice completed the investigation into Jowers' claims but did not find evidence of conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers admitted that he had fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she corroborated his story to get money to pay her income tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2002, The New York Times reported that a church minister, Ronald Denton Wilson, claimed his father, Henry Clay Wilson, assassinated King. He stated, \"It wasn't a racist thing; he thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.\" Wilson provided no evidence to back up his claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "King researchers David Garrow and Gerald Posner disagreed with Pepper's claims that the government killed King. In 2003, Pepper published a book about the investigation and trial, as well as his representation of James Earl Ray in his bid for a trial. James Bevel also disputed the argument that Ray acted alone, stating, \"There is no way a ten-cent white boy could develop a plan to kill a million-dollar black man.\" In 2004, Jesse Jackson stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is there were saboteurs to disrupt the march. And within our own organization, we found a very key person who was on the government payroll. So infiltration within, saboteurs from without and the press attacks. ... I will never believe that James Earl Ray had the motive, the money and the mobility to have done it himself. Our government was very involved in setting the stage for and I think the escape route for James Earl Ray.\n",
      "King's legacy includes influences on the Black Consciousness Movement and civil rights movement in South Africa.

      "The Martin Luther King Fund and Foundation in the UK was set up as a charity on December 30, 1969, after King's assassination and following a visit to the UK in 1969 by his widow, Coretta King. The Foundation's first chairman, Canon John Collins, stated that the Foundation was to be an active UK national campaign for racial equality, its work also to include community projects in areas of social need, and education. International Personnel (IP), an employment agency, was formed in 1970 out of the foundation's base in Balham, to find employment for professionally qualified black people. In its first year, the agency placed ten percent of its applicants in jobs equal to their ability. The Balham Training Scheme operated an evening school with lecturers in Typing, Shorthand, English and Math. The foundation was removed from the Charity Commission list on November 18, 1996, as it had ceased to exist.\n",

      "King has become a national icon in the history of American liberalism and American progressivism. His main legacy was to secure progress on civil rights in the U.S. Just days after King's assassination, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Title VIII of the Act, commonly known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, familial status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination. The day following King's assassination, teacher Jane Elliott conducted her first \"Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes\" exercise with her class of elementary school students to help them understand King's death as it related to racism.\n",

      "Beginning in 1971, cities and states established annual holidays to honor King. On November 2, 1983, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor King. Observed for the first time on January 20, 1986, it is called Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Following President George H. W. Bush's 1992 proclamation, the holiday is observed on the third Monday of January each year, near the time of King's birthday. On January 17, 2000, for the first time, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was officially observed in all fifty U.S. states.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates King liturgically on January 15.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Christian minister, King's main influence was Jesus Christ and the Christian gospels, which he would almost always quote in his speeches. King's faith was strongly based in the Golden Rule, loving God above all, and loving your enemies. His nonviolent thought was also based in the injunction to turn the other cheek in the Sermon on the Mount, and Jesus' teaching of putting the sword back into its place (Matthew 26:52). In his Letter from Birmingham Jail, King urged action consistent with what he describes as Jesus' \"extremist\" love, and also quoted numerous other Christian pacifist authors. In another sermon, he stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry. I don't plan to run for any political office. I don't plan to do anything but remain a preacher. And what I'm doing in this struggle, along with many others, grows out of my feeling that the preacher must be concerned about the whole man.\n",

      "African-American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin was King's first regular advisor on nonviolence. King was also advised by the white activists Harris Wofford and Glenn Smiley. Rustin and Smiley came from the Christian pacifist tradition, and Wofford and Rustin both studied Mahatma Gandhi's teachings. Rustin had applied nonviolence with the Journey of Reconciliation campaign in the 1940s, and Wofford had been promoting Gandhism to Southern blacks since the early 1950s.\n",
      "\n",
      "King initially knew little about Gandhi and rarely used the term \"nonviolence\" during his early activism. King initially believed in and practiced self-defense, even obtaining guns to defend against possible attackers. The pacifists showing him the alternative of nonviolent resistance, arguing that this would be a better means to accomplish his goals. King then vowed to no longer personally use arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a chapter of Stride Toward Freedom, King outlined his understanding of nonviolence, which seeks to win an opponent to friendship, rather than to humiliate or defeat him. The chapter draws from an address by Wofford, with Rustin and Stanley Levison also providing guidance and ghostwriting.\n",

      "King was inspired by Gandhi and his success with nonviolent activism, and as a theology student, King described Gandhi as being one of the \"individuals who greatly reveal the working of the Spirit of God\". King had \"for a long time ... wanted to take a trip to India.\" With assistance from Harris Wofford, the American Friends Service Committee, and other supporters, he was able to fund the journey in April 1959. The trip deepened his understanding of nonviolent resistance and his commitment to America's struggle for civil rights. In a radio address made during his final evening in India, King reflected, \"Since being in India, I am more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, King hailed the \"successful precedent\" of using nonviolence \"in a magnificent way by Mohandas K. Gandhi to challenge the might of the British Empire ... He struggled only with the weapons of truth, soul force, non-injury and courage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another influence for King's nonviolent method was Henry David Thoreau's essay On Civil Disobedience and its theme of refusing to cooperate with an evil system. He also was greatly influenced by the works of Protestant theologians Reinhold Niebuhr and Paul Tillich, and said that Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis left an \"indelible imprint\" on his thinking by giving him a theological grounding for his social concerns. King was moved by Rauschenbusch's vision of Christians spreading social unrest in \"perpetual but friendly conflict\" with the state, simultaneously critiquing it and calling it to act as an instrument of justice. However, he was apparently unaware of the American tradition of Christian pacifism exemplified by Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison. King frequently referred to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount as central for his work. Before 1960, King also sometimes used the concept of \"agape\" (brotherly Christian love).\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after renouncing personal use of guns, King had a complex relationship with self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary. Throughout his career King was frequently protected by other civil rights activists who carried arms, such as Colonel Stone Johnson, Robert Hayling, and the Deacons for Defense and Justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was criticized by other black leaders in the civil rights movement. This included more militant thinkers such as Nation of Islam member Malcolm X. Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee founder Ella Baker regarded King as a charismatic media figure who lost touch with the grassroots of the movement as he became close to elite figures like Nelson Rockefeller. Stokely Carmichael, a protege of Baker's, became a black separatist and disagreed with King's plea for racial integration because he considered it an insult to a uniquely African-American culture. He also took issue that King's non-violence approach depended on appealing to America's conscience, feeling America had none to appeal to.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was an avid supporter of Native American rights and Native Americans were active supporters of King's civil rights movement. The Native American Rights Fund (NARF) was patterned after the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund. The National Indian Youth Council (NIYC) was especially supportive in King's campaigns especially the Poor People's Campaign in 1968. In King's book Why We Can't Wait he writes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Our nation was born in genocide when it embraced the doctrine that the original American, the Indian, was an inferior race. Even before there were large numbers of Negroes on our shores, the scar of racial hatred had already disfigured colonial society. From the sixteenth century forward, blood flowed in battles over racial supremacy. We are perhaps the only nation which tried as a matter of national policy to wipe out its indigenous population. Moreover, we elevated that tragic experience into a noble crusade. Indeed, even today we have not permitted ourselves to reject or to feel remorse for this shameful episode. Our literature, our films, our drama, our folklore all exalt it.\n",
      "In the late 1950, the remaining Creek in Alabama were trying to completely desegregate schools. Light-complexioned Native children were allowed to ride buses to previously all-white schools, while dark-skinned Native children from the same band were barred from the same buses. Tribal leaders, hearing of King's desegregation campaign in Birmingham, contacted him for assistance. Through his intervention the problem was quickly resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 1959, after giving a speech at the University of Arizona on the ideals of using nonviolent methods in creating social change, King stated his belief that one must not use force in this struggle \"but match the violence of his opponents with his suffering.\" King then went to Southside Presbyterian, a predominantly Native American church, and was fascinated by their photos; he wanted to go to an Indian Reservation to meet the people so Casper Glenn took King to the Papago Indian Reservation. He met with all the tribal leaders, visited another Presbyterian church near the reservation, and preached there, attracting a Native American crowd. He later returned to Old Pueblo in March 1962 where he preached again to a Native American congregation. King would continue to attract the attention of Native Americans throughout the civil rights movement. During the 1963 March on Washington there was a sizable Native American contingent, including many from South Dakota and from the Navajo nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was a major inspiration, along with the civil rights movement, of the Native American rights movement of the 1960s and many of its leaders. John Echohawk, a member of the Pawnee tribe who was the executive director and a founder of the Native American Rights Fund, stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspired by Dr. King, who was advancing the civil rights agenda of equality under the laws of this country, we thought that we could also use the laws to advance our Indianship, to live as tribes in our territories governed by our own laws under the principles of tribal sovereignty that had been with us ever since 1831. We believed that we could fight for a policy of self-determination that was consistent with U.S. law and that we could govern our own affairs, define our own ways and continue to survive in this society.\n",
      "As the leader of the SCLC, King maintained a policy of not publicly endorsing a U.S. political party or candidate: \"I feel someone must remain in the position of non-alignment, so that he can look objectively at both parties and be the conscience of both—not the servant or master of either.\" In a 1958 interview, he expressed his view that neither party was perfect, saying, \"I don't think the Republican party is a party full of the almighty God nor is the Democratic party. They both have weaknesses ... And I'm not inextricably bound to either party.\" King did praise Democratic Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois as being the \"greatest of all senators\" because of his fierce advocacy for civil rights causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "King critiqued both parties' performance on promoting racial equality:\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, the Negro has been betrayed by both the Republican and the Democratic party. The Democrats have betrayed him by capitulating to the whims and caprices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed him by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of reactionary right-wing northern Republicans. And this coalition of southern Dixiecrats and right-wing reactionary northern Republicans defeats every bill and every move towards liberal legislation in the area of civil rights.\n",
      "Although King never publicly supported a political party or candidate for president, in a letter to a civil rights supporter in October 1956 he said that he had not decided whether he would vote for Democrat Adlai Stevenson II or Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1956 presidential election, but that \"In the past, I always voted the Democratic ticket.\" In his autobiography, King says that in 1960 he privately voted for Democratic candidate John F. Kennedy: \"I felt that Kennedy would make the best president. I never came out with an endorsement. My father did, but I never made one.\" King adds that he likely would have made an exception to his non-endorsement policy for a second Kennedy term, saying \"Had President Kennedy lived, I would probably have endorsed him in 1964.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1964, King urged his supporters \"and all people of goodwill\" to vote against Republican Senator Barry Goldwater for president, saying that his election \"would be a tragedy, and certainly suicidal almost, for the nation and the world.\" King believed Robert F. Kennedy would make for a good president, but also believed that he wouldn't beat Johnson in the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries. He also expressed support for the possible presidential candidacies of Republicans Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Charles Percy. \n",
      "\n",
      "King rejected both laissez-faire capitalism and communism; King had read Marx while at Morehouse but rejected communism because of its \"materialistic interpretation of history\" that denied religion, its \"ethical relativism\", and its \"political totalitarianism\". He stated that one focused too much on the individual while the other focused too much on the collective. The American philosopher Tommie Shelby has described King as a social democrat who advocated for advocating economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal-democratic polity and a capitalist-oriented mixed economy. However, he was often reluctant to speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of social democratic (\"socialist\") movements with communism. King believed that a laissez-faire economic system would not adequately provide the necessities of many American people, particularly African Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a 1952 letter to Coretta Scott, he said: \"I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic ...\" In one speech, he stated that \"something is wrong with capitalism\" and said, \"There must be a better distribution of wealth, and maybe America must move toward a democratic socialism.\" King further said that \"capitalism has outlived its usefulness\" and \"failed to meet the needs of the masses\".\n",
      "\n",
      "King stated that black Americans, as well as other disadvantaged Americans, should be compensated for historical wrongs. In an interview conducted for Playboy in 1965, he said that granting black Americans only equality could not realistically close the economic gap between them and whites. King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50 billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "He posited that \"the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation through a spectacular decline in school dropouts, family breakups, crime rates, illegitimacy, swollen relief rolls, rioting and other social evils.\" He presented this idea as an application of the common law regarding settlement of unpaid labor but clarified that he felt that the money should not be spent exclusively on blacks. He stated, \"It should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Actress Nichelle Nichols planned to leave the science-fiction television series Star Trek in 1967 after its first season. She changed her mind after talking to King, who was a fan of the show. King explained that her character signified a future of greater racial cooperation. King told Nichols, \"You are our image of where we're going, you're 300 years from now, and that means that's where we are and it takes place now. Keep doing what you're doing, you are our inspiration.\" As Nichols recounted: \n",
      "Star Trek was one of the only shows that [King] and his wife Coretta would allow their little children to watch. And I thanked him and I told him I was leaving the show. All the smile came off his face. And he said, 'Don't you understand for the first time we're seen as we should be seen. You don't have a black role. You have an equal role.'\n",
      " The series' creator, Gene Roddenberry, was deeply moved upon learning of King's support.\n",
      "\n",
      "FBI director J. Edgar Hoover personally ordered surveillance of King, with the intent to undermine his power as a civil rights leader. The Church Committee, a 1975 investigation by the U.S. Congress, found that \"From December 1963 until his death in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was the target of an intensive campaign by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'neutralize' him as an effective civil rights leader.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In the fall of 1963, the FBI received authorization from Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy to proceed with wiretapping of King's phone lines, purportedly due to his association with Stanley Levison. The Bureau informed President John F. Kennedy. He and his brother unsuccessfully tried to persuade King to dissociate himself from Levison, a New York lawyer who had been involved with Communist Party USA. Although Robert Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's telephone lines \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\", Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bureau placed wiretaps on the home and office phone lines of both Levison and King, and bugged King's rooms in hotels as he traveled across the country. In 1967, Hoover listed the SCLC as a black nationalist hate group, with the instructions: \"No opportunity should be missed to exploit through counterintelligence techniques the organizational and personal conflicts of the leaderships of the groups ... to insure  [sic] the targeted group is disrupted, ridiculed, or discredited.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In a secret operation code-named \"Minaret\", the National Security Agency monitored the communications of leading Americans, including King, who were critical of the U.S. war in Vietnam. A review by the NSA itself concluded that Minaret was \"disreputable if not outright illegal\".\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, Hoover had been suspicious of potential influence of communists in social movements such as labor unions and civil rights. Hoover directed the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC when it was established.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the relationship between King and Stanley Levison, the FBI feared Levison was working as an \"agent of influence\" over King, in spite of its own reports in 1963 that Levison had left the Party and was no longer associated in business dealings with them. Another King lieutenant, Jack O'Dell, was also linked to the Communist Party by sworn testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the extensive surveillance, by 1976 the FBI had acknowledged that it had not obtained any evidence that King himself or the SCLC were actually involved with any communist organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "For his part, King adamantly denied having any connections to communism. In a 1965 Playboy interview, he stated that \"there are as many Communists in this freedom movement as there are Eskimos in Florida.\" He argued that Hoover was \"following the path of appeasement of political powers in the South\" and that his concern for communist infiltration of the civil rights movement was meant to \"aid and abet the salacious claims of southern racists and the extreme right-wing elements.\" Hoover replied by saying that King was \"the most notorious liar in the country\". After his \"I Have A Dream\" speech, the FBI described King as \"the most dangerous and effective Negro leader in the country\". It alleged that he was \"knowingly, willingly and regularly cooperating with and taking guidance from communists.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The attempts to prove that King was a communist was related to the feeling of many segregationists that blacks in the South were content with the status quo but had been stirred up by \"communists\" and \"outside agitators\". King said that \"the Negro revolution is a genuine revolution, born from the same womb that produces all massive social upheavals—the womb of intolerable conditions and unendurable situations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "CIA files declassified in 2017 revealed that the agency was investigating possible links between King and Communism after a Washington Post article dated November 4, 1964, claimed he was invited to the Soviet Union and that Ralph Abernathy, as spokesman for King, refused to comment on the source of the invitation. Mail belonging to King and other civil rights activists was intercepted by the CIA program HTLINGUAL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI attempted to discredit King through revelations regarding his private life. FBI surveillance of King, some of it since made public, attempted to demonstrate that he had numerous extramarital affairs. The FBI distributed reports regarding such affairs to the executive branch, friendly reporters, potential coalition partners and funding sources of the SCLC, and King's family. The bureau also sent anonymous letters to King threatening to reveal information if he did not cease his civil rights work. The FBI–King suicide letter sent to King just before he received the Nobel Peace Prize read, in part:\n",
      "\n",
      "The American public, the church organizations that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know you for what you are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant  [sic]). You are done. There is but one way out for you. You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.\n",
      "The letter was accompanied by a tape recording—excerpted from FBI wiretaps—of several of King's extramarital liaisons. King interpreted this package as an attempt to drive him to suicide, although William Sullivan, head of the Domestic Intelligence Division at the time, argued that it may have only been intended to \"convince Dr. King to resign from the SCLC.\" King refused to succumb to the FBI's threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1977, Judge John Lewis Smith Jr. ordered the recorded audiotapes and written transcripts resulting from the FBI's electronic surveillance of King between 1963 and 1968 to sealed from public access in the National Archives until 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 2019, an FBI file emerged on which a handwritten note alleged that King \"looked on, laughed and offered advice\" as one of his friends raped a woman. Historians of the period who have examined this notional evidence have dismissed it as highly unreliable. David Garrow, author of an earlier biography of King, wrote that \"the suggestion ... that he either actively tolerated or personally employed violence against any woman, even while drunk, poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible\". Garrow's reliance on a handwritten note addended to a typed report is considered poor scholarship by several other authorities. The professor of American studies at the University of Nottingham, Peter Ling, pointed out that Garrow was excessively credulous, if not naive, in accepting the accuracy of FBI reports during a period when the FBI was undertaking a massive operation to attempt to discredit King. Experts in 20th-century American history, including Distinguished Professor of Political Science Jeanne Theoharis, the professors Barbara Ransby of the University of Illinois at Chicago, Nathan Connolly of Johns Hopkins University and Professor Emeritus of History Glenda Gilmore of Yale University have expressed reservations about Garrow's scholarship. Theoharis commented \"Most scholars I know would penalize graduate students for doing this.\" It is not the first time the care and rigor of Garrow's work has been called into serious question. Clayborne Carson, Martin Luther King biographer and overseer of the Dr. King records at Stanford University states that he came to the opposite conclusion of Garrow: \n",
      "None of this is new. Garrow is talking about a recently added summary of a transcript of a 1964 recording from the Willard Hotel that others, including Mrs. King, have said they did not hear Martin's voice on it. The added summary was four layers removed from the actual recording. This supposedly new information comes from an anonymous source in a single paragraph in an FBI report. You have to ask how could anyone conclude King looked at a rape from an audio recording in a room where he was not present.\n",
      " The tapes that could confirm or refute the allegation are scheduled to be declassified in 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his 1989 autobiography And the Walls Came Tumbling Down, Ralph Abernathy stated that King had a \"weakness for women\", although they \"all understood and believed in the biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just that he had a particularly difficult time with that temptation.\" In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term \"womanizing\", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated.\n",
      "In his 1986 book Bearing the Cross, David Garrow wrote about a number of extramarital affairs, including one woman King saw almost daily. According to Garrow, \"that relationship ... increasingly became the emotional centerpiece of King's life, but it did not eliminate the incidental couplings ... of King's travels.\" He alleged that King explained his extramarital affairs as \"a form of anxiety reduction\". Garrow asserted that King's supposed promiscuity caused him \"painful and at times overwhelming guilt\". King's wife Coretta appeared to have accepted his affairs with equanimity, saying once that \"all that other business just doesn't have a place in the very high-level relationship we enjoyed.\" Shortly after Bearing the Cross was released, civil rights author Howell Raines gave the book a positive review but opined that Garrow's allegations about King's sex life were \"sensational\" and stated that Garrow was \"amassing facts rather than analyzing them\".\n",
      "\n",
      "A fire station was located across from the Lorraine Motel, next to the boarding house in which James Earl Ray was staying. Police officers were stationed in the fire station to keep King under surveillance. Agents were watching King at the time he was shot. Immediately following the shooting, officers rushed to the motel. Marrell McCollough, an undercover police officer, was the first person to administer first aid to King. The antagonism between King and the FBI, the lack of an all points bulletin to find the killer, and the police presence nearby led to speculation that the FBI was involved in the assassination.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was awarded at least fifty honorary degrees from colleges and universities. On October 14, 1964, King became the youngest winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to him for leading nonviolent resistance to racial prejudice in the U.S. In 1965, he was awarded the American Liberties Medallion by the American Jewish Committee for his \"exceptional advancement of the principles of human liberty.\" In his acceptance remarks, King said, \"Freedom is one thing. You have it all or you are not free.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1957, he was awarded the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP. Two years later, he won the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story. In 1966, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America awarded King the Margaret Sanger Award for \"his courageous resistance to bigotry and his lifelong dedication to the advancement of social justice and human dignity.\" Also in 1966, King was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In November 1967, he made a 24-hour trip to the UK to receive an honorary Doctorate in Civil Law from Newcastle University, becoming the first African American the institution had recognized in this way. In an impromptu acceptance speech, he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three urgent and indeed great problems that we face not only in the United States of America but all over the world today. That is the problem of racism, the problem of poverty and the problem of war.\n",
      "In addition to his nominations for three Grammy Awards, King posthumously won for Best Spoken Word Recording in 1971 for \"Why I Oppose The War In Vietnam\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1977, President Jimmy Carter posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to King. The citation read:\n",
      "\n",
      "Martin Luther King Jr. was the conscience of his generation. He gazed upon the great wall of segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.\n",
      "King and his wife were also awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "King was second in Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century. In 1963, he was named Time Person of the Year, and, in 2000, he was voted sixth in an online \"Person of the Century\" poll by the same magazine. King placed third in The Greatest American conducted by the Discovery Channel and AOL.\n",

      "Shah Rukh Khan (pronounced [ˈʃɑːɦɾʊx xɑːn] ⓘ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi films. Referred to in the media as the \"Baadshah of Bollywood\" and \"King Khan\",[a] he has appeared in more than 90 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in Swades (2004), a hockey coach in Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as \"Brand SRK\" because of his many endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education and the World Economic Forum's Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women's and children's rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers' poll by Empire, and in 2023, Time named him as one of the most influential people in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India. Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and affiliated with the Indian National Congress. He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[c]  According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan. However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan. As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University. When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later. Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[c] His parents were married in 1959.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi. He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[d] Khan has described himself on Twitter as \"half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi. His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments. Khan attended St. Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football, and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour. Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play. Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz. One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress. Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG), where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John. After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career. He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.\n",
      "\n",
      "His father died of cancer in 1981,[e] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes. After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960) fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her. Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992). Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90), and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989). His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991, citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death. He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films. His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai, and by June, he had started his first shoot. His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992. In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career; he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance. Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla. His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was \"sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr. The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\". His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\". Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences. Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\". For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir. Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification. The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan's best performance, calling him \"spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart\". Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit. At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking \"insane risks\" and \"pushing the envelope\" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career. The director Mukul S. Anand called him \"the new face of the industry\" at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a \"romantic hero\". Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an \"all time blockbuster\" by Box Office India, with an estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards. The director and critic Raja Sen said, \"Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1996, all four of Khan's releases failed critically and commercially, but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination. Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai's diasporic-themed social drama Pardes, portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States. Khan's final release of 1997 was the second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt's action comedy Duplicate, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar's production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received, but India Today lauded Khan for his energetic performance. The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se.., the third instalment of Mani Ratnam's trilogy of terror films. In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar's romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of the 1990s, a \"pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment.\" Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year, although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.\n",
      "\n",
      "The roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India. He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office, it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role, which he lost to Govinda for Haseena Maan Jaayegi. Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited. The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure. It was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan. Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying \"Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little.\" Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan. He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan. On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote, \"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan's historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response, but it performed poorly at Indian box offices. As losses continued to mount for the production company, Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited. In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi's Shakti: The Power. He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films. By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London. Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "Successes during this time included Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein (2000), and Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), which Khan cites as a turning point in his career. Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men. Khan's performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for Mohabbatein. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance Devdas. At a cost of over ₹500 million (US$10.29 million), it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time, and became a box office success, earning approximately ₹1.68 billion ($35 million) worldwide. The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan, and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year. Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences. Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza's Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film's success.\n",
      "\n",
      "2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer. In the company's first production, he starred in Farah Khan's directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain. Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise. It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million).\n",
      "\n",
      "In his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker's social drama Swades (meaning \"Homeland\"), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of \"Bollywoodised realism\", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema. In December 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film. Derek Elley of Variety found Khan's performance \"unsettling\" as \"a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants\", but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date. He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for Swades. Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood's \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar's fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), in which he played an unhappily married man who has an extramarital affair with a married woman. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, emerged as India's highest-grossing film in the overseas market, earning more than ₹1.13 billion (US$25.62 million) worldwide. Both his roles in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards, despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a nobody who shouldn't have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell everyone that there's this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that ... I'll do it, I am an actor. But I can't start believing in this myth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " —Khan reflecting in 2007 on his position as the Hindi film industry's top star\n",
      "In 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coaches the Indian women's national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films' semi-fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university's hockey team, essentially portrayed himself as a \"cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim\". Faring well in both India and abroad, Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance, which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been \"without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks\", portraying Kabir Khan \"like a real flesh-and-blood human being\". Filmfare included his performance in their 2010 issue of the \"Top 80 Iconic Performances\". In the same year, Khan starred\n",
      "alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan's reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad. Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare. Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote, \"the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature style—spontaneous and intuitively intelligent\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite Anushka Sharma, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role to have been \"tailor-made\" for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents, although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj. In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009. He performed a special appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan—a fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone. As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after hairdressers across the country complained that the word \"barber\" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.\n",
      "\n",
      "After refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol. The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a \"symbol of assertive rasa values\" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood. To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition. Upon release, My Name is Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar. Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with \"averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts\", believing it to have been a \"standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval\".\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha's superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his children. The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood's most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of ₹1.25 billion (US$26.78 million). Despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross of ₹2.4 billion (US$51.42 million). The film, and Khan's portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, though they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar. Khan's second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel to Don (2006). To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself. His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, \"Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts\". The year's highest grossing Bollywood production abroad, it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan's only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra's last picture, the romantic drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan's first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one. Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success earning over ₹2.11 billion (US$39.49 million) worldwide. The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2. At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra's other past heroines.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Chennai Express for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth. The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for \"re-rendering every old trick in the acting book\". Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost ₹4 billion (US$68.26 million) in worldwide ticket sales. On International Women's Day in 2013, The Times of India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success. In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan's ensemble action comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director. Although Khan's unidimensional character was criticised, the film became a major commercial success grossing ₹3.8 billion (US$64.85 million) worldwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Dilwale (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68 million). Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, \"With Dilwale, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer\", and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired. He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma's action thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be \"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable\" and thought that Khan was aptly \"creepy\" as the obsessive admirer. The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula. Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Rahul Dholakia's action crime film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-hero—a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan's performance to be \"inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms\". Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about ₹3.08 billion (US$47.3 million) worldwide. Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali's Jab Harry Met Sejal (2017). In a review for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan's pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed \"similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age\". He reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai's romantic drama Zero (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle. The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan's performance. Writing for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen commended his \"dominating performance and tremendous energy\" and Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost called him an \"excellent fit\" for the role for allowing his \"naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight\". Both Jab Harry Met Sejal and Zero were box office flops.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a Box Office India report, Khan's stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well. Following the release of Zero, Khan took a four-year break from full-time acting, which was partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India. He took the time off to attempt a career comeback. During this period, he made extended special appearances in the 2022 films Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Rocketry: The Nambi Effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India. Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan's \"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit\", while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a \"much-needed makeover\" of an ageing Khan into an action star. Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan's stardom. Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers. Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that \"Khan's screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor\". Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan. Both films grossed over ₹10 billion (US$130 million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema's second and third biggest grossers worldwide, making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his final release of 2023, Khan starred in Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki, a social drama about an illegal immigration technique named donkey flight. Uday Bhatia wrote that his role as a \"romantic feminist soldier patriot friend\" marked \"a break from Khan the action star but offers no respite from the Khan the perfect screen idol\". Grossing over ₹4 billion (US$50 million), Dunki emerged as Khan's third consecutive commercial success of the year, although it did not match up to the record grosses of Pathaan or Jawan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited. After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment, which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising. As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films. Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters. Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the popular song \"Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila\". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012). For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen Awards. In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, and a year later, Khan began hosting Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?. In 2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV's Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout, the Indian version of Wipeout; scenes featuring Khan were shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai. Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star. In 2017, Khan began hosting TED Talks India Nayi Soch, a talk show produced by TED Conferences, LLC which started aired on STAR Plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle's Moments in Time concert in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for the Shahrukh–Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert. The same year, he participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol, and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year. In 2002, Khan featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester's Old Trafford and London's Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than 100,000 people. Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St. Joseph High School field in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150 years of India–South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan started an association with the \"Temptations\" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22 venues across the world. The show played to 15,000 spectators at Dubai's Festival City Arena. In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands. Another tour was held with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta, and in 2013 another series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney. In 2014, Khan performed in SLAM! The Tour in the US, Canada, and London, and also hosted the Indian premiere of the live talent show, Got Talent World Stage Live.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for US$75.09 million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). As of 2009[update], KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of US$42.1 million. The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years. Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012 and repeated the feat in 2014. The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan performed alongside Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening ceremony of the IPL 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs. He appeared again in 2013 alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull. In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) banned him from the Wankhede Stadium for five years for getting into an argument with the security staff after a match between KKR and the Mumbai Indians. Khan had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter, were being \"manhandled\" by the security staff and that the officials were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behaviour, he had been abused with communal indecent comment. Later MCA officials had accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of Mumbai Indians after the match in another version of the story, which Khan had maintained it was done to support their action and for cheap publicity. Wankhede guard later contradicted MCA officials' claim and said Shah Rukh Khan had not hit him. Khan later apologised to his fans after his team won the final match. MCA revoked the ban in 2015 and in 2016, Mumbai Police informed that no 'cognisable offence' was made out against Khan and they had come to the conclusion that Shah Rukh Khan was not drunk and did not use abusive language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as \"King Khan\", \"The Baadshah of Bollywood\", or \"The King of Bollywood\".[a] Anupama Chopra cites him as an \"ever present celebrity\", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities. He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion. Newsweek named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him \"the world's biggest movie star\". In 2011 he was described as \"the biggest movie star you've never heard of...perhaps the world's biggest movie star, period\" by Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times[f] and has been called the world's biggest movie star in other international media outlets.[b] According to a popularity survey, 3.2 billion people around the world know Khan, more than who know Tom Cruise. In a 2022 readers' poll by Empire magazine, Khan was listed as one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. The magazine attributed his success to the \"outrageous amounts of [his] charisma and absolute mastery of [his] craft. Comfortable in almost every genre going, there's pretty much nothing he can't do.\" In 2023, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and he topped the list per a readers poll.\n",

      "Khan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential people in India. He has regularly featured among the top ten on The Times of India's list of the 50 most desirable men in India, and in a 2007 poll by the magazine Eastern Eye he was named the sexiest man in Asia.

Khan has endorsed brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer.
